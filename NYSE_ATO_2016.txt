To Our
Shareholders

In fiscal 2016, Atmos Energy continued to pursue its goal  
of becoming the nation’s safest natural gas distributor through 
significant infrastructure investments.

•	 	We	replaced	approximately	570	miles	
of aging natural gas distribution and 
transmission pipelines to make our 
system safer and more reliable.
•	 	We	conducted	over	89,000	hours	of	
training for our service, construction 
and maintenance technicians to pre-
pare them for providing safe service.
•	 	We	adopted	highly	advanced	tech-
nology to help us detect pipeline 
leaks, and we launched a multi-year 
information-technology project to 
manage and document construction 
for our pipeline modernization program.

We	also	did	very	well	financially:

•	 	Reported	earnings	per	diluted	share	
in fiscal 2016 went up 29 cents, or 
9.4 percent, to $3.38, marking our 
14th consecutive annual increase. Net 
income for the fiscal year was $350 
million, compared to $315 million in 
fiscal 2015.
•	 	Dividends	paid	in	fiscal	2016	were	
$1.68 per share. In November 2016, 
the board of directors continued our 
trend of consecutive annual dividend 

increases for the 33rd year by raising 
the indicated rate by 7.1 percent for 
fiscal 2017 to $1.80 per share.
•	 	Total	shareholder	return	in	fiscal	2016	
was 31 percent.
•	 	Our	stock	closed	at	$74.47	per	share		
on September 30, 2016.

The capital investments we are making to 
replace, fortify and expand our distri-
bution and transmission pipelines are 
generating improved safety metrics and 
excellent financial results. In fiscal year 
2016, we invested $1.1 billion of capital, 
which was a 13 percent increase over 
fiscal year 2015. Over 80 percent of that 
spending was dedicated to safety and 
reliability projects; that proportion in fiscal 
2017 is expected to be over 80 percent.
 Because of balanced rate designs and 
regulatory mechanisms in the eight states 
we serve, we begin earning a return on 
about 95% of our annual capital expen-
ditures within six months of the test year 
end and 99 percent within 12 months of 
the test year end.

Kim R. Cocklin
Chief Executive Officer

 Reducing “regulatory lag” to promptly 
recover our investments is the result of 
foresight and focus on our core business. 
When Chairman of the Board Robert W. 
Best was CEO, Atmos Energy officials 
began seeking constructive regulatory 
outcomes at state legislatures and before 
public utility commissions. Reducing 
regulatory lag provides utilities like  
Atmos Energy the ability to attract funding 
to modernize our pipeline assets and to 
maintain stable earnings.

Large Investments, Yet Low 
Customer Bills

Regulatory authorities in the states we 
serve recognize the critical need to ac-
celerate our capital outlays for replacing 
aging infrastructure. As a result of their 
support for implementing innovative rate 
mechanisms, we are now in a favorable 
position to continue our pipeline infra-
structure program far into the future.
Equally favorable is the effect on our 
customers’ bills. Our customers’ monthly 
bills essentially have stayed flat, with the 
infrastructure investments being offset by 
gas prices that have remained very afford-
able. Customers’ bills have averaged less 
than $60 a month since 2007. We project 
that our average monthly bill will remain

T O O U R S H A R E H O L D E R S

We are significantly upgrading our infrastructure—with all the 
incumbent benefits of public safety and reliability of gas 
deliveries even on the coldest days—while our customers’ monthly 
bills remain affordable.

if natural gas prices follow analysts’ 
expectations. After taking into account 
inflation, our bills actually will go down. 
Atmos Energy’s annualized monthly gas 
bills may, in fact, be one of the lowest 
costs in the household budget of our 
average residential customer.

Financial Results

Contributions to fiscal 2016 net income 
were $232 million from regulated dis-

tribution operations, $102 million from 
regulated pipeline operations, and $16 
million from nonregulated operations.
Net operating income increases resulting 
from ratemaking activity totaled $103 
million in fiscal 2016, compared to $115 
million in fiscal 2015. An additional $15 
million of rate requests were filed during 
fiscal 2016 but were still in various stages 
of review at the end of the fiscal year.  
 At September 30, 2016, our balance 
sheet had a debt-to-capital ratio of 48.5 
percent, compared to 47.7 percent as of 

the fiscal 2015 year-end. The Company 
had about $500 million in net liquidity to 
meet anticipated financial needs.
In early October 2016, we amended 
an existing $1.25 billion revolving credit 
agreement, which increased our com-
mitted loan facility to $1.5 billion and 
extended the facility through September 
25, 2021 and retained an “accordion” 
feature, which affords Atmos Energy the 
opportunity to increase the facility to 
$1.75 billion.

an annual growth rate of between 6 percent and 8 percent, with 
a total annual return to shareholders ranging between 
9 percent and 11 percent through fiscal 2020.

ratings were upgraded to A by Standard 
and Poor’s with a ratings outlook of Stable. 

Outlook

Our strategy is to invest in our existing 
assets rather than to acquire more utility 
properties. We own more than 75,000 
miles of distribution and transmission 
pipelines, and have 3.1 million service 
lines to customers’ premises. 
 Our comprehensive infrastructure 
renewal and modernization program 
allows us to remove cast iron and bare 
steel pipe and replace or fortify older 
coated steel pipelines and early vintage 
plastic pipe.
 We have replaced nearly 1,000 miles 
of cast iron, bare steel and early-generation 
plastic pipe since 2010, and we expect to 
double our replacement mileage during 
the next five years.
 Our capital spending for fiscal 2017 
is forecast to be between $1.1 billion 
and $1.25 billion. We expect our annual 
capital expenditures through fiscal 2020 
will be about $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion.
 Our total rate base of regulated assets is

expected to grow from 
approximately $5.9 bil-
lion at the end of fiscal 
2016 to between $8.5 
billion and $9.0 
billion by the end of 
fiscal 2020 at an annual 
rate of between 9 per-
cent and 10 percent.
 Accordingly, we 
project that earnings 
per diluted share will 
increase at an annual 
growth rate of between 6 percent and 
8 percent, with a total annual return to 
shareholders ranging between 9 percent 
and 11 percent through fiscal 2020. 
 Our previously announced guidance 
for earnings per diluted share in fiscal 
2017 ranges between $3.45 and $3.65. 
Net income from continuing operations 
is forecast to be between $365 million 
and $390 million.

Leadership Update

Atmos Energy is pleased that two addi-
tional distinguished leaders have joined 
our Board of Directors.
   In March 2016, Rafael G. Garza was 
named to our board. He is a co-founder 
and managing director of Bravo Equity. 
Since 1989, Mr. Garza has worked almost 
exclusively on U.S./Mexico businesses, 
specifically those benefiting from the 
U.S. Hispanic market. Mr. Garza has 
been a frequent speaker at forums ad-
dressing U.S. Hispanic growth and U.S./
Mexico relations.
Prior to founding Bravo Equity (and its  
predecessor firm, RGG Capital Partners), 

Mr. Garza was country manager of Ernst 
& Young’s Corporate Finance Unit in 
Mexico, where he assisted some 100 
companies with investment transactions. 
Based in Mexico City from 1996 to 2000, 
he specialized in investment advisory 
services, including private debt and 
equity transactions, mergers and acquisi-
tions, restructurings, privatizations, and 
strategic financial planning. 
Effective November 1, 2016, Kelly H. 
Compton joined our board. Since 1992, 
Ms. Compton has served as the executive 
director of The Hoglund Foundation and 
is responsible for the management and 
oversight of all areas of operations.
 Before joining the foundation, Ms. 
Compton was with NationsBank Texas 
and its predecessors for 13 years. She was 
vice president of commercial lending, 
with responsibility for marketing and 
loan administration for middle market 
companies in the Dallas area. 
 These leaders are supported by our 
4,700 employees, who are committed to 
serving our customers exceptionally well 
while ensuring safety for themselves, 
their fellow employees and the people in 
the 1,400 communities we serve. On our 
continued journey to becoming the safest 
natural gas company, we have the right 
people in place, getting the right results 
the right way.

Overview and Strategy

Atmos Energy Corporation, headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and incorporated in Texas and Virginia, is
engaged primarily in the regulated natural gas distribution and pipeline businesses as well as other nonregulated
natural gas businesses. We deliver natural gas through regulated sales and transportation arrangements to over
three million residential, commercial, public authority and industrial customers in eight states located primarily
in the South, which makes us one of the country’s largest natural-gas-only distributors based on number of cus-
tomers. We also operate one of the largest intrastate pipelines in Texas based on miles of pipe.

Our nonregulated businesses provide natural gas management, marketing, transportation and storage serv-
ices to municipalities, local gas distribution companies, including certain of our natural gas distribution divisions
and industrial customers principally in the Midwest and Southeast.

Atmos Energy’s vision is to be the safest provider of natural gas services. We intend to achieve this vision

by:

‰ operating our business exceptionally well

‰

investing in our people and infrastructure

‰ enhancing our culture.

We believe the successful execution of this strategy has delivered excellent shareholder value. Over the last
five years, we have achieved growth by making significant capital investments to fortify and upgrade our dis-
tribution and transmission systems and successfully recovering these investments through regulatory mechanisms
designed to minimize regulatory lag.

Our core values include focusing on our employees and customers while conducting our business with
honesty and integrity. We continue to strengthen our culture through ongoing communications with our employ-
ees and enhanced employee training.

Operating Segments

We operate the Company through the following three segments:

‰ The regulated distribution segment, which includes our regulated distribution and related sales operations

‰ The regulated pipeline segment, which includes the pipeline and storage operations of our Atmos Pipe-
line — Texas Division and

‰ The nonregulated segment, which includes our nonregulated natural gas management, nonregulated natu-
ral gas transmission, storage and other services.

These operating segments are described in greater detail below.

Regulated Distribution Segment Overview

Our regulated distribution segment is comprised of our six regulated natural gas distribution divisions. This
segment represents approximately 65 percent of our consolidated net income. The following table summarizes
key information about these divisions, presented in order of total rate base. We operate in our service areas under
terms of non-exclusive franchise agreements granted by the various cities and towns that we serve. At Sep-
tember 30, 2016, we held 1,003 franchises having terms generally ranging from five to 35 years. A significant
number of our franchises expire each year, which require renewal prior to the end of their terms. Historically, we
have successfully renewed these franchises and believe that we will continue to be able to renew our franchises
as they expire.

Revenues in this operating segment are established by regulatory authorities in the states in which we oper-
ate. These rates are intended to be sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business and to provide a reasonable
return on invested capital. In addition, we transport natural gas for others through our distribution system.

Rates established by regulatory authorities often include cost adjustment mechanisms for costs that (i) are
subject to significant price fluctuations compared to our other costs, (ii) represent a large component of our cost
of service and (iii) are generally outside our control.

Purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms represent a common form of cost adjustment mechanism. Pur-
chased gas cost adjustment mechanisms provide natural gas distribution companies a method of recovering pur-
chased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case because they provide a dollar-for-dollar offset to
increases or decreases in natural gas distribution gas costs. Therefore, although substantially all of our dis-
tribution operating revenues fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase, distribution gross profit (which is
defined as operating revenues less purchased gas cost) is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas.

Additionally, some jurisdictions have performance-based ratemaking adjustments to provide incentives to
distribution companies to minimize purchased gas costs through improved storage management and use of finan-
cial instruments to lock in gas costs. Under the performance-based ratemaking adjustment, purchased gas costs
savings are shared between the utility and its customers.

Our supply of natural gas is provided by a variety of suppliers, including independent producers, marketers
and pipeline companies and withdrawals of gas from proprietary and contracted storage assets. Additionally, the
natural gas supply for our Mid-Tex Division includes peaking and spot purchase agreements.

Supply arrangements consist of both base load and swing supply (peaking) quantities and are contracted
from our suppliers on a firm basis with various terms at market prices. Base load quantities are those that flow at
a constant level throughout the month and swing supply quantities provide the flexibility to change daily quanti-
ties to match increases or decreases in requirements related to weather conditions.

Except for local production purchases, we select our natural gas suppliers through a competitive bidding
process by periodically requesting proposals from suppliers that have demonstrated that they can provide reliable

5

service. We select these suppliers based on their ability to deliver gas supply to our designated firm pipeline
receipt points at the lowest reasonable cost. Major suppliers during fiscal 2016 were Concord Energy LLC,
ConocoPhillips Company, Devon Gas Services, L.P., Gulf South Pipeline Company LP, Sequent Energy
Management, LP, Targa Gas Marketing LLC, Tenaska Gas Storage, LLC, Texas Gas Transmission Corporation,
Texla Energy Management, Inc. and Atmos Energy Marketing, LLC and Trans Louisiana Gas Pipeline, Inc.,
which are wholly owned subsidiaries in our nonregulated segment.

The combination of base load, peaking and spot purchase agreements, coupled with the withdrawal of gas
held in storage, allows us the flexibility to adjust to changes in weather, which minimizes our need to enter into
long-term firm commitments. We estimate our peak-day availability of natural gas supply to be approximately
4.4 Bcf. The peak-day demand for our distribution operations in fiscal 2016 was on January 10, 2016, when sales
to customers reached approximately 2.5 Bcf.

Currently, our distribution divisions, except for our Mid-Tex Division, utilize 40 pipeline transportation
companies, both interstate and intrastate, to transport our natural gas. The pipeline transportation agreements are
firm and many of them have “pipeline no-notice” storage service, which provides for daily balancing between
system requirements and nominated flowing supplies. These agreements have been negotiated with the shortest
term necessary while still maintaining our right of first refusal. The natural gas supply for our Mid-Tex Division
is delivered primarily by our Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division (APT).

To maintain our deliveries to high priority customers, we have the ability, and have exercised our right, to
curtail deliveries to certain customers under the terms of interruptible contracts or applicable state regulations or
statutes. Our customers’ demand on our system is not necessarily indicative of our ability to meet current or
anticipated market demands or immediate delivery requirements because of factors such as the physical limi-
tations of gathering, storage and transmission systems, the duration and severity of cold weather, the availability
of gas reserves from our suppliers, the ability to purchase additional supplies on a short-term basis and actions by
federal and state regulatory authorities. Curtailment rights provide us the flexibility to meet the human-needs
requirements of our customers on a firm basis. Priority allocations imposed by federal and state regulatory agen-
cies, as well as other factors beyond our control, may affect our ability to meet the demands of our customers.
We do not anticipate any problems with obtaining additional gas supply as needed for our customers.

Regulated Pipeline Segment Overview

Our regulated pipeline segment consists of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of APT. APT is one
of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in Texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gas-
producing areas of central, northern and eastern Texas, extending into or near the major producing areas of the
Barnett Shale, the Texas Gulf Coast and the Delaware and Val Verde Basins of West Texas. Through it, APT
provides transportation and storage services to our Mid-Tex Division, other third party local distribution compa-
nies, industrial and electric generation customers, marketers and producers. As part of its pipeline operations,
APT owns and operates five underground storage reservoirs in Texas. This segment represents approximately 30
percent of our consolidated operations.

Gross profit earned from transportation and storage services for APT is subject to traditional ratemaking
governed by the RRC. Rates are updated through periodic filings made under Texas’ Gas Reliability Infra-
structure Program (GRIP). GRIP allows us to include in our rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in
the prior calendar year provided that we file a complete rate case at least once every five years. APT’s existing
regulatory mechanisms allow certain transportation and storage services to be provided under market-based rates.

Nonregulated Segment Overview

Our nonregulated operations are conducted through Atmos Energy Holdings, Inc. (AEH), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Atmos Energy Corporation, and typically represent approximately five percent of our consolidated net
income. AEH’s primary business is to buy, sell and deliver natural gas at competitive prices to approximately 1,000
customers located primarily in the Midwest and Southeast areas of the United States. AEH accomplishes this
objective by aggregating and purchasing gas supply, arranging transportation and storage logistics and effectively

6

managing commodity price risk. AEH also earns storage and transportation demand fees primarily from our regu-
lated distribution operations in Louisiana and Kentucky. These demand fees are subject to regulatory oversight and
are renewed periodically.

Ratemaking Activity

Overview

The method of determining regulated rates varies among the states in which our regulated businesses oper-
ate. The regulatory authorities have the responsibility of ensuring that utilities in their jurisdictions operate in the
best interests of customers while providing utility companies the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their
investment. Generally, each regulatory authority reviews rate requests and establishes a rate structure intended to
generate revenue sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business and to provide a reasonable return on
invested capital.

Our rate strategy focuses on reducing or eliminating regulatory lag, obtaining adequate returns and provid-
ing stable, predictable margins, which benefit both our customers and the Company. As a result of our rate-
making efforts in recent years, Atmos Energy has:

‰ Formula rate mechanisms in place in four states that provide for an annual rate review and adjustment to
rates.

‰ Infrastructure programs in place in the majority of our states that provide for an annual rate adjustment to
rates for qualifying capital expenditures. Through our annual formula rate mechanisms and infrastructure
programs, we have the ability to recover over 90 percent of our capital expenditures within six months.

‰ Authorization in tariffs, statute or commission rules that allows us to defer certain elements of our cost of
service until they are included in rates, such as depreciation, ad valorem taxes and pension costs.

‰ WNA mechanisms in seven states that serve to minimize the effects of weather on approximately 97 per-
cent of our distribution gross margin.

‰ The ability to recover the gas cost portion of bad debts in five states.

(5) On April 1, 2014, a rate case settlement approved by the West Texas Cities reestablished an annual rate
mechanism for all West Texas Division cities except Amarillo, Channing, Dalhart and Lubbock.
(6) The bad debt rider allows us to recover from ratepayers the gas cost portion of uncollectible accounts.
(7) The performance-based rate program provides incentives to distribution companies to minimize purchased
gas costs by allowing the companies and its customers to share the purchased gas costs savings.

Although substantial progress has been made in recent years by improving rate design and recovery of
investment across Atmos Energy’s operating areas, we will continue to seek improvements in rate design to
address cost variations and pursue tariffs that reduce regulatory lag associated with investments. Further, poten-
tial changes in federal energy policy, federal safety regulations and adverse economic conditions will necessitate
continued vigilance by the Company and our regulators in meeting the challenges presented by these external
factors.

Recent Ratemaking Activity

Substantially all of our regulated revenues in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014
were derived from sales at rates set by or subject to approval by local or state authorities. Net operating income
increases resulting from ratemaking activity totaling $122.5 million, $114.5 million and $93.3 million, became
effective in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, as summarized below:

Our recent ratemaking activity is discussed in greater detail below.

Annual Formula Rate Mechanisms

As an instrument to reduce regulatory lag, formula rate mechanisms allow us to refresh our rates on an
annual basis without filing a formal rate case. However, these filings still involve discovery by the appropriate
regulatory authorities prior to the final determination of rates under these mechanisms. We currently have for-
mula rate mechanisms in our Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee operations and in substantially all of our
Texas divisions. Additionally, we have specific infrastructure programs in substantially all of our distribution
divisions and our Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division with tariffs in place to permit the investment associated with
these programs to have their surcharge rate adjusted annually to recover approved capital costs incurred in a prior
test-year period. The following table summarizes our annual formula rate mechanisms by state.

Rate Case Filings
A rate case is a formal request from Atmos Energy to a regulatory authority to increase rates that are
charged to customers. Rate cases may also be initiated when the regulatory authorities request us to justify our
rates. This process is referred to as a “show cause” action. Adequate rates are intended to provide for recovery of
the Company’s costs as well as a fair rate of return to our shareholders and ensure that we continue to safely
deliver reliable, reasonably priced natural gas service to our customers. The following table summarizes our
recent rate cases:

Other Regulation

Each of our regulated distribution divisions and our regulated pipeline division is regulated by various state
or local public utility authorities. We are also subject to regulation by the United States Department of Trans-
portation with respect to safety requirements in the operation and maintenance of our transmission and dis-
tribution facilities. In addition, our regulated operations are also subject to various state and federal laws
regulating environmental matters. From time to time we receive inquiries regarding various environmental mat-
ters. We believe that our properties and operations substantially comply with, and are operated in substantial
conformity with, applicable safety and environmental statutes and regulations. There are no administrative or
judicial proceedings arising under environmental quality statutes pending or known to be contemplated by gov-
ernmental agencies which would have a material adverse effect on us or our operations. Our environmental
claims have arisen primarily from former manufactured gas plant sites.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) allows, pursuant to Section 311 of the Natural Gas
Policy Act, gas transportation services through our Atmos Pipeline — Texas assets “on behalf of” interstate pipe-
lines or local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines, without subjecting these assets to the juris-
diction of the FERC. Additionally, the FERC has regulatory authority over the sale of natural gas in the
wholesale gas market and the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity. The FERC also has
authority to detect and prevent market manipulation and to enforce compliance with FERC’s other rules, policies
and orders by companies engaged in the sale, purchase, transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate
commerce. We have taken what we believe are the necessary and appropriate steps to comply with these regu-
lations.

In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted, representing an extensive overhaul of the framework for
regulation of U.S. financial markets. The Dodd-Frank Act required various regulatory agencies, including the
SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, to establish regulations for implementation of many of
the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. A number of those regulations have been adopted; we have enacted new
procedures and modified existing business practices and contractual arrangements to comply with such regu-
lations. We expect additional regulations to be issued, which should provide additional clarity regarding the
extent of the impact of this legislation on us. The costs of participating in financial markets for hedging certain

13

risks inherent in our business may be further increased when these expected additional regulations are adopted.
We also anticipate that the Commodities Futures Trading Commission will issue additional regulations related to
reporting and disclosure obligations.

Competition

Although our regulated distribution operations are not currently in significant direct competition with any
other distributors of natural gas to residential and commercial customers within our service areas, we do compete
with other natural gas suppliers and suppliers of alternative fuels for sales to industrial customers. We compete in
all aspects of our business with alternative energy sources, including, in particular, electricity. Electric utilities
offer electricity as a rival energy source and compete for the space heating, water heating and cooking markets.
Promotional incentives, improved equipment efficiencies and promotional rates all contribute to the acceptability
of electrical equipment. The principal means to compete against alternative fuels is lower prices, and natural gas
historically has maintained its price advantage in the residential, commercial and industrial markets.

Our regulated pipeline operations historically faced competition from other existing intrastate pipelines
seeking to provide or arrange transportation, storage and other services for customers. In the last few years, sev-
eral new pipelines have been completed, which has increased the level of competition in this segment of our
business.

Within our nonregulated operations, AEM competes with other natural gas marketers to provide natural gas
management and other related services primarily to smaller customers requiring higher levels of balancing,
scheduling and other related management services. AEM has experienced increased competition in recent years
primarily from investment banks and major integrated oil and natural gas companies who offer lower cost, basic
services. The increased competition has reduced margins most notably on its high-volume accounts.

Employees

At September 30, 2016, we had 4,747 employees, consisting of 4,639 employees in our regulated operations
and 108 employees in our nonregulated operations.

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors.

Our financial and operating results are subject to a number of risk factors, many of which are not within our
control. Although we have tried to discuss key risk factors below, please be aware that other or new risks may
prove to be important in the future. Investors should carefully consider the following discussion of risk factors as
well as other information appearing in this report. These factors include the following:

The Company is dependent on continued access to the credit and capital markets to execute our business
strategy.

Our long-term debt is currently rated as “investment grade” by Standard & Poor’s Corporation, Moody’s
Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch Ratings, Ltd. Similar to most companies, we rely upon access to both short-term
and long-term credit and capital markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements. If adverse credit conditions were to
cause a significant limitation on our access to the private and public capital markets, we could see a reduction in
our liquidity. A significant reduction in our liquidity could in turn trigger a negative change in our ratings out-
look or even a reduction in our credit ratings by one or more of the three credit rating agencies. Such a down-
grade could further limit our access to private credit and/or public capital markets and increase our costs of
borrowing.

Further, if our credit ratings were downgraded, we could be required to provide additional liquidity to our
nonregulated segment because the commodity financial instrument markets could become unavailable to us. Our
nonregulated segment depends primarily upon an intercompany lending facility between AEH and Atmos Energy
to finance its working capital needs, supplemented by two small credit facilities with outside lenders. Our ability
to provide this liquidity to AEH for our nonregulated operations is limited by the terms of the lending arrange-
ment with AEH, which is subject to annual approval by one state regulatory commission.

While we believe we can meet our capital requirements from our operations and the sources of financing
available to us, we can provide no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so in the future, especially if
the market price of natural gas increases significantly in the near term. The future effects on our business, liquid-
ity and financial results of a deterioration of current conditions in the credit and capital markets could be material
and adverse to us, both in the ways described above or in other ways that we do not currently anticipate.

We are subject to state and local regulations that affect our operations and financial results.

Our regulated distribution and regulated pipeline segments are subject to regulatory oversight from various
state and local regulatory authorities in the eight states that we serve in our regulated distribution and pipeline
segments. Therefore, our returns are continuously monitored and are subject to challenge for their reasonableness
by the appropriate regulatory authorities or other third-party intervenors. In the normal course of business, as a
regulated entity, we often need to place assets in service and establish historical test periods before rate cases that
seek to adjust our allowed returns to recover that investment can be filed. Further, the regulatory review process
can be lengthy in the context of traditional ratemaking. Because of this process, we suffer the negative financial
effects of having placed assets in service without the benefit of rate relief, which is commonly referred to as
“regulatory lag.”

However, in the last several years, a number of regulatory authorities in the states we serve have approved
rate mechanisms that provide for annual adjustments to rates that allow us to recover the cost of investments
made to replace existing infrastructure or reflect changes in our cost of service. These mechanisms work to effec-
tively reduce the regulatory lag inherent in the ratemaking process. However, regulatory lag could significantly
increase if the regulatory authorities modify or terminate these rate mechanisms. The regulatory process also
involves the risk that regulatory authorities may (i) review our purchases of natural gas and adjust the amount of
our gas costs that we pass through to our customers or (ii) limit the costs we may have incurred from our cost of
service that can be recovered from customers.

15

A deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect our customers and negatively impact our
financial results.

Any adverse changes in economic conditions in the United States, especially in the states in which we oper-
ate, could adversely affect the financial resources of many domestic households and lead to an increase in mort-
gage defaults and significant decreases in the values of our customers’ homes and investment assets. As a result,
our customers could seek to use even less gas and make it more difficult for them to pay their gas bills. This
would likely lead to slower collections and higher than normal levels of accounts receivable. This, in turn, would
probably increase our financing requirements. Additionally, should economic conditions deteriorate, our
industrial customers could seek alternative energy sources, which could result in lower sales volumes.

Inflation and increased gas costs could adversely impact our customer base and customer collections and
increase our level of indebtedness.

Over time, inflation has caused increases in some of our operating expenses and has required assets to be
replaced at higher costs. We have a process in place to continually review the adequacy of our distribution gas
rates in relation to the increasing cost of providing service and the inherent regulatory lag in adjusting those gas
rates. Historically, we have been able to budget and control operating expenses and investments within the
amounts authorized to be collected in rates and intend to continue to do so. However, the ability to control
expenses is an important factor that could impact future financial results.

In addition, rapid increases in the costs of purchased gas would cause us to experience a significant increase
in short-term debt. We must pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased, which can be significantly in advance of
when these costs may be recovered through the collection of monthly customer bills for gas delivered. Increases
in purchased gas costs also slow our natural gas distribution collection efforts as customers are more likely to
delay the payment of their gas bills, leading to higher than normal accounts receivable. This could result in
higher short-term debt levels, greater collection efforts and increased bad debt expense.

If contracted gas supplies, interstate pipeline and/or storage services are not available or delivered in a
timely manner, our ability to meet our customers’ natural gas requirements may be impaired and our
financial condition may be adversely affected.

In order to meet our customers’ annual and seasonal natural gas demands, we must obtain a sufficient sup-
ply of natural gas, interstate pipeline capacity and storage capacity. If we are unable to obtain these, either from
our suppliers’ inability to deliver the contracted commodity or the inability to secure replacement quantities, our
financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. If a substantial disruption to or reduction
in interstate natural gas pipelines’ transmission and storage capacity occurred due to operational failures or dis-
ruptions, legislative or regulatory actions, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, terrorist or cyber-attacks or acts of war,
our operations or financial results could be adversely affected.

We are exposed to market risks that are beyond our control, which could adversely affect our financial
results and capital requirements.

We are subject to market risks beyond our control, including (i) commodity price volatility caused by mar-
ket supply and demand dynamics, counterparty performance or counterparty creditworthiness, and (ii) interest
rate risk.

Our regulated operations are generally insulated from commodity price risk through its purchased gas cost
mechanisms. Although our nonregulated operations represent only about five percent of our consolidated finan-
cial results, commodity price volatility experienced in this business segment could lead to some minor volatility
in our earnings. Our nonregulated segment manages margins and limits risk exposure on the sale of natural gas
inventory or the offsetting fixed-price purchase or sale commitments for physical quantities of natural gas
through the use of a variety of financial instruments. However, contractual limitations could adversely affect our
ability to withdraw gas from storage, which could cause us to purchase gas at spot prices in a rising market to

16

obtain sufficient volumes to fulfill customer contracts. We could also realize financial losses on our efforts to
limit risk as a result of volatility in the market prices of the underlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to
perform under a contract.
With respect to interest rate risk, we have been operating in a relatively low interest-rate environment in
recent years compared to historical norms for both short and long-term interest rates. However, increases in
interest rates could adversely affect our future financial results.

The concentration of our distribution, pipeline and storage operations in the State of Texas exposes our
operations and financial results to economic conditions, weather patterns and regulatory decisions in
Texas.
Over 50 percent of our regulated distribution customers and most of our regulated pipeline assets and oper-
ations are located in the State of Texas. This concentration of our business in Texas means that our operations
and financial results may be significantly affected by changes in the Texas economy in general, weather patterns
and regulatory decisions by state and local regulatory authorities in Texas.

Our operations are subject to increased competition.
In residential and commercial customer markets, our regulated distribution operations compete with other
energy products, such as electricity and propane. Our primary product competition is with electricity for heating,
water heating and cooking. Increases in the price of natural gas could negatively impact our competitive position
by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consumer. This could adversely impact our business if, as a
result, our customer growth slows, reducing our ability to make capital expenditures, or if our customers further
conserve their use of gas, resulting in reduced gas purchases and customer billings.
In the case of industrial customers, such as manufacturing plants, adverse economic conditions, including
higher gas costs, could cause these customers to use alternative sources of energy, such as electricity, or bypass
our systems in favor of special competitive contracts with lower per-unit costs. Our regulated pipeline operations
historically have faced limited competition from other existing intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to
provide or arrange transportation, storage and other services for customers. However, in the last few years, sev-
eral new pipelines have been completed, which has increased the level of competition in this segment of our
business.
Finally, within our nonregulated operations, AEM competes with other natural gas marketers to provide
natural gas management and other related services primarily to smaller customers requiring higher levels of bal-
ancing, scheduling and other related management services. AEM has experienced increased competition in recent
years from competitors who offer lower cost, basic services.

Adverse weather conditions could affect our operations or financial results.
We have weather-normalized rates for over 95 percent of our residential and commercial meters in our regu-
lated distribution business, which substantially mitigates the adverse effects of warmer-than-normal weather for
meters in those service areas. However, there is no assurance that we will continue to receive such regulatory
protection from adverse weather in our rates in the future. The loss of such weather-normalized rates could have
an adverse effect on our operations and financial results. In addition, our regulated distribution and regulated
pipeline operating results may continue to vary somewhat with the actual temperatures during the winter heating
season. Sustained cold weather could adversely affect our nonregulated operations as we may be required to
purchase gas at spot rates in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes to fulfill some customer contracts. Addi-
tionally, sustained cold weather could challenge our ability to adequately meet customer demand in our natural
gas distribution and pipeline and storage operations.

Our growth in the future may be limited by the nature of our business, which requires extensive capital
spending.
The regulated natural gas distribution and pipeline business is capital-intensive. We must make significant
capital expenditures to renew or replace our facilities on a long-term basis to improve the safety and reliability of

17

our facilities and to comply with the safety rules and regulations issued by the regulatory authorities responsible
for the service areas we operate. In addition, we must continually build new capacity in our regulated distribution
and regulated pipeline operations to serve the growing needs of the communities we serve. The magnitude of
these expenditures may be affected by a number of factors, including new regulations, the general state of the
economy and weather.

The liquidity required to fund our capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a variety of
sources, including our cash flows from operations, borrowings under our short-term lending facilities, and, from
time to time, funds raised from the public debt and equity capital markets. The cost and availability of borrowing
funds from third party lenders or issuing equity is dependent on the liquidity of the credit markets, interest rates
and other market conditions. This in turn may limit the amount of funds we can invest in our infrastructure.

The costs of providing health care benefits, pension and postretirement health care benefits and related
funding requirements may increase substantially.

We provide health care benefits, a cash-balance pension plan and postretirement health care benefits to eligi-
ble full-time employees. The costs of providing health care benefits to our employees could significantly increase
over time due to rapidly increasing health care inflation, and any future legislative changes related to the provi-
sion of health care benefits. The impact of additional costs which are likely to be passed on to the Company are
difficult to measure at this time.

The costs of providing a cash-balance pension plan to eligible full-time employees prior to 2011 and post-
retirement health care benefits to eligible full-time employees and related funding requirements could be influ-
enced by changes in the market value of the assets funding our pension and postretirement health care plans. Any
significant declines in the value of these investments due to sustained declines in equity markets or a reduction in
bond yields could increase the costs of our pension and postretirement health care plans and related funding
requirements in the future. Further, our costs of providing such benefits and related funding requirements are also
subject to a number of factors, including (i) changing demographics, including longer life expectancy of benefi-
ciaries and an expected increase in the number of eligible former employees over the next five to ten years;
(ii) various actuarial calculations and assumptions which may differ materially from actual results due primarily
to changing market and economic conditions, including changes in interest rates, and higher or lower withdrawal
rates; and (iii) future government regulation.

The costs to the Company of providing these benefits and related funding requirements could also increase
materially in the future, should there be a material reduction in the amount of the recovery of these costs through
our rates or should significant delays develop in the timing of the recovery of such costs, which could adversely
affect our financial results.

The inability to continue to hire, train and retain operational, technical and managerial personnel could
adversely affect our results of operations.

The average age of the employee base of Atmos Energy has been increasing for a number of years, with a
number of employees becoming eligible to retire within the next five to 10 years. If we were unable to hire
appropriate personnel to fill future needs, the Company could encounter operating challenges and increased
costs, primarily due to a loss of knowledge, errors due to inexperience or the lengthy time period typically
required to adequately train replacement personnel. In addition, higher costs could result from the increased use
of contractors to replace retiring employees, loss of productivity or increased safety compliance issues. The
inability to hire, train and retain new operational, technical and managerial personnel adequately and to transfer
institutional knowledge and expertise could adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business. If we
were unable to hire, train and retain appropriately qualified personnel, our results of operations could be
adversely affected.

We may experience increased federal, state and local regulation of the safety of our operations.

The safety and protection of the public, our customers and our employees is our top priority. We constantly
monitor and maintain our pipeline and distribution system to ensure that natural gas is delivered safely, reliably

18

and efficiently through our network of more than 72,000 miles of pipeline and distribution lines. However, in
recent years, natural gas distribution and pipeline companies have continued to face increasing federal, state and
local oversight of the safety of their operations. Although we believe these costs should be ultimately recoverable
through our rates, the costs of complying with new laws and regulations may have at least a short-term adverse
impact on our operating costs and financial results.

Some of our operations are subject to increased federal regulatory oversight that could affect our operations
and financial results.
FERC has regulatory authority over some of our operations, including sales of natural gas in the wholesale
gas market and the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity. FERC has adopted rules designed
to prevent market power abuse and market manipulation and to promote compliance with FERC’s other rules,
policies and orders by companies engaged in the sale, purchase, transportation or storage of natural gas in inter-
state commerce. These rules carry increased penalties for violations. Although we have taken steps to structure
current and future transactions to comply with applicable current FERC regulations, changes in FERC regu-
lations or their interpretation by FERC or additional regulations issued by FERC in the future could also
adversely affect our business, financial condition or financial results.

We are subject to environmental regulations which could adversely affect our operations or financial
results.
We are subject to laws, regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal, state and
local governmental authorities relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including
those that govern discharges of substances into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous
substances and waste, the clean-up of contaminated sites, groundwater quality and availability, plant and wildlife
protection, as well as work practices related to employee health and safety. Environmental legislation also
requires that our facilities, sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated, maintained,
abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities. Failure to comply with these
laws, regulations, permits and licenses may expose us to fines, penalties or interruptions in our operations that
could be significant to our financial results. In addition, existing environmental regulations may be revised or our
operations may become subject to new regulations.

The operations and financial results of the Company could be adversely impacted as a result of climate
changes or related additional legislation or regulation in the future.
To the extent climate changes occur, our businesses could be adversely impacted, although we believe it is
likely that any such resulting impacts would occur very gradually over a long period of time and thus would be
difficult to quantify with any degree of specificity. To the extent climate changes would result in warmer
temperatures in our service territories, financial results could be adversely affected through lower gas volumes
and revenues. Such climate changes could also cause shifts in population, including customers moving away
from our service territories near the Gulf Coast in Louisiana and Mississippi.
Another possible climate change would be more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurri-
canes and tornadoes, which could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our
customers. If we were unable to deliver natural gas to our customers, our financial results would be impacted by
lost revenues, and we generally would have to seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs. To the
extent we would be unable to recover those costs, or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs
would result in reduced demand for our services, our future business, financial condition or financial results
could be adversely impacted.
In addition, there have been a number of federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives proposed in
recent years in an attempt to control or limit the effects of global warming and overall climate change, including
greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide. The adoption of this type of legislation by Congress or similar
legislation by states or the adoption of related regulations by federal or state governments mandating a substantial
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the future could have far-reaching and significant impacts on the energy
industry. Such new legislation or regulations could result in increased compliance costs for us or additional oper-

19

ating restrictions on our business, affect the demand for natural gas or impact the prices we charge to our custom-
ers. At this time, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws or regulations that may be adopted on our
future business, financial condition or financial results.

Distributing, transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and additional
operating costs.

Our regulated distribution and regulated pipeline businesses involve a number of hazards and operating risks
that cannot be completely avoided, such as leaks, accidents and operational problems, which could cause loss of
human life, as well as substantial financial losses resulting from property damage, damage to the environment
and to our operations. We maintain liability and property insurance coverage in place for many of these hazards
and risks. However, because some of our pipeline, storage and distribution facilities are near or are in populated
areas, any loss of human life or adverse financial results resulting from such events could be large. If these events
were not fully covered by our general liability and property insurance, which policies are subject to certain limits
and deductibles, our operations or financial results could be adversely affected.

Cyber-attacks or acts of cyber-terrorism could disrupt our business operations and information technology
systems or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer, employee or Company
information.

Our business operations and information technology systems may be vulnerable to an attack by individuals
or organizations intending to disrupt our business operations and information technology systems, even though
the Company has implemented policies, procedures and controls to prevent and detect these activities. We use
our information technology systems to manage our distribution and intrastate pipeline operations and other busi-
ness processes. Disruption of those systems could adversely impact our ability to safely deliver natural gas to our
customers, operate our pipeline systems or serve our customers timely. Accordingly, if such an attack or act of
terrorism were to occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.

In addition, we use our information technology systems to protect confidential or sensitive customer,
employee and Company information developed and maintained in the normal course of our business. Any attack
on such systems that would result in the unauthorized release of customer, employee or other confidential or
sensitive data could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation, increase our costs and expose us to
additional material legal claims and liability. Even though we have insurance coverage in place for many of these
cyber-related risks, if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur, our operations and financial results could
be adversely affected to the extent not fully covered by such insurance coverage.

Natural disasters, terrorist activities or other significant events could adversely affect our operations or
financial results.

Natural disasters are always a threat to our assets and operations. In addition, the threat of terrorist activities
could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in the price of natural gas that could affect our oper-
ations. Also, companies in our industry may face a heightened risk of exposure to actual acts of terrorism, which
could subject our operations to increased risks. As a result, the availability of insurance covering such risks may
become more limited, which could increase the risk that an event could adversely affect our operations or finan-
cial results.

Properties.
Distribution, transmission and related assets
At September 30, 2016, in our regulated distribution segment, we owned an aggregate of 70,593 miles of
underground distribution and transmission mains throughout our distribution systems. These mains are located on
easements or rights-of-way which generally provide for perpetual use. We maintain our mains through a program

20

of continuous inspection and repair and believe that our system of mains is in good condition. Through our regu-
lated pipeline segment we owned 5,446 miles of gas transmission lines as well as 111 miles of transmission and
gathering lines through our nonregulated segment.

Storage Assets
We own underground gas storage facilities in several states to supplement the supply of natural gas in peri-
ods of peak demand. The following table summarizes certain information regarding our underground gas storage
facilities at September 30, 2016:

ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

INTRODUCTION

This section provides management’s discussion of the financial condition, changes in financial condition
and results of operations of Atmos Energy Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries with specific
information on results of operations and liquidity and capital resources. It includes management’s interpretation
of our financial results, the factors affecting these results, the major factors expected to affect future operating
results and future investment and financing plans. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our con-
solidated financial statements and notes thereto.

Several factors exist that could influence our future financial performance, some of which are described in
Item 1A above, “Risk Factors”. They should be considered in connection with evaluating forward-looking state-
ments contained in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since these factors could cause actual
results and conditions to differ materially from those set out in such forward-looking statements.

Cautionary Statement for the Purposes of the Safe Harbor under the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995

The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may contain “forward-looking statements”
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Report are forward-looking state-
ments made in good faith by us and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in this Report, or any other of our documents or
oral presentations, the words “anticipate”, “believe”, “estimate”, “expect”, “forecast”, “goal”, “intend”,
“objective”, “plan”, “projection”, “seek”, “strategy” or similar words are intended to identify forward-looking
statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results
to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements relating to our strategy, operations, mar-
kets, services, rates, recovery of costs, availability of gas supply and other factors. These risks and uncertainties
include the following: our ability to continue to access the credit markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements;
regulatory trends and decisions, including the impact of rate proceedings before various state regulatory commis-
sions; the impact of adverse economic conditions on our customers; the effects of inflation and changes in the
availability and price of natural gas; the availability and accessibility of contracted gas supplies, interstate pipe-
line and/or storage services; market risks beyond our control affecting our risk management activities, including
commodity price volatility, counterparty creditworthiness or performance and interest rate risk; the concentration
of our distribution, pipeline and storage operations in Texas; increased competition from energy suppliers and
alternative forms of energy; adverse weather conditions; the capital-intensive nature of our regulated distribution
business; increased costs of providing health care benefits along with pension and postretirement health care
benefits and increased funding requirements; the inability to continue to hire, train and retain appropriate person-
nel; possible increased federal, state and local regulation of the safety of our operations; increased federal regu-
latory oversight and potential penalties; the impact of environmental regulations on our business; the impact of
climate changes or related additional legislation or regulation in the future; the inherent hazards and risks
involved in operating our distribution and pipeline and storage businesses; the threat of cyber-attacks or acts of
cyber-terrorism that could disrupt our business operations and information technology systems; natural disasters,
terrorist activities or other events and other risks and uncertainties discussed herein, all of which are difficult to
predict and many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, while we believe these forward-looking state-
ments to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that they will approximate actual experience or that the
expectations derived from them will be realized. Further, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of
our forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judg-
ments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of

25

contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions
that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from estimates.

Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. The
accounting policies discussed below are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results
of operations and require management to make difficult, subjective or complex accounting estimates. Accord-
ingly, these critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically by the Audit Committee of the Board of Direc-
tors.

Critical
Accounting Policy

Summary of Policy

Factors Influencing
Application of the Policy

Regulation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Our regulated distribution and pipeline operations
meet the criteria of a cost-based, rate-regulated
entity under accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Accordingly, the
financial results for these operations reflect the
effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices
and policies of the various regulatory commis-
sions to which we are subject.

As a result, certain costs that would normally be
expensed under accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States are permitted to be
capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet
because it is probable they can be recovered
through rates. Further, regulation may impact the
period in which revenues or expenses are recog-
nized. The amounts expected to be recovered or
recognized are based upon historical experience
and our understanding of the regulations.

Discontinuing the application of this method of
accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities or
changes in the accounting for our various regu-
latory mechanisms could significantly increase our
operating expenses as fewer costs would likely be
capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet, which
could reduce our net income.

Unbilled Revenue . . . . . . . . . We follow the revenue accrual method of account-
ing for regulated distribution segment revenues
whereby revenues attributable to gas delivered to
customers, but not yet billed under the cycle bill-
ing method, are estimated and accrued and the
related costs are charged to expense.

On occasion, we are permitted to implement new
rates that have not been formally approved by our
regulatory authorities, which are subject to refund.
We recognize this revenue and establish a reserve
for amounts that could be refunded based on our
experience for the jurisdiction in which the rates
were implemented.

Summary of Policy

Pension and other postretirement plan costs and
liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis
using a September 30 measurement date and are
affected by numerous assumptions and estimates
including the market value of plan assets, esti-
mates of the expected return on plan assets,
assumed discount rates and current demographic
and actuarial mortality data. The assumed discount
rate and the expected return are the assumptions
that generally have the most significant impact on
our pension costs and liabilities. The assumed
discount rate, the assumed health care cost trend
rate and assumed rates of retirement generally
have the most significant impact on our
postretirement plan costs and liabilities.

The discount rate is utilized principally in calculat-
ing the actuarial present value of our pension and
postretirement obligations and net periodic pen-
sion and postretirement benefit plan costs. When
establishing our discount rate, we consider high
quality corporate bond rates based on bonds avail-
able in the marketplace that are suitable for set-
tling the obligations, changes in those rates from
the prior year and the implied discount rate that is
derived from matching our projected benefit dis-
bursements with currently available high quality
corporate bonds.

The expected long-term rate of return on assets is
utilized in calculating the expected return on plan
assets component of our annual pension and post-
retirement plan costs. We estimate the expected
return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond
returns, equity risk premiums, asset allocations,
the effects of active plan management, the impact
of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical
performance. We also consider the guidance from
our investment advisors in making a final
determination of our expected rate of return on
assets. To the extent the actual rate of return on
assets realized over the course of a year is greater
than or less than the assumed rate, that year’s
annual pension or postretirement plan costs are not
affected. Rather, this gain or loss reduces or
increases future pension or postretirement plan
costs over a period of approximately ten to twelve
years.

The market-related value of our plan assets repre-
sents the fair market value of the plan assets,
adjusted to smooth out short-term market fluctua-
tions over a five-year period. The use of this

Contingencies . . . . . . . . . . . .

methodology will delay the impact of current
market fluctuations on the pension expense for the
period.

We estimate the assumed health care cost trend
rate used in determining our postretirement net
expense based upon our actual health care cost
experience, the effects of recently enacted legis-
lation and general economic conditions. Our
assumed rate of retirement is estimated based
upon our annual review of our participant census
information as of the measurement date.
In the normal course of business, we are con-
fronted with issues or events that may result in a
contingent liability. These generally relate to
uncollectible receivables, lawsuits, claims made
by third parties or the action of various regulatory
agencies. We recognize these contingencies in our
consolidated financial statements when we
determine, based on currently available facts and
circumstances it is probable that a liability has
been incurred or an asset will not be recovered,
and an amount can be reasonably estimated.

Actual results may differ from estimates, depend-
ing on actual outcomes or changes in the facts or
expectations surrounding each potential exposure.
Changes in the estimates related to contingencies
could have a negative impact on our consolidated
results of operations, cash flows or financial posi-
tion. Our contingencies are further discussed in
Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.

Financial instruments and
hedging activities . . . . . . . We use financial instruments to mitigate commod-
ity price risk and interest rate risk. The objectives
for using financial instruments have been tailored
to meet the needs of our regulated and non-
regulated businesses. These objectives are more
fully described in Note 13 to the consolidated
financial statements.

We record all of our financial instruments on the
balance sheet at fair value as required by account-

Summary of Policy

accounting elections for financial instruments and
hedging activities utilized are more fully described
in Note 13 to the consolidated financial state-
ments.

The criteria used to determine if a financial instru-
ment meets the definition of a derivative and
qualifies for hedge accounting treatment are
complex and require management to exercise
professional judgment. Further, as more fully
discussed below, significant changes in the fair
value of these financial instruments could materi-
ally impact our financial position, results of oper-
ations or cash flows. Finally, changes in the
effectiveness of the hedge relationship could
impact the accounting treatment.

Fair Value
Measurements . . . . . . . . . We report certain assets and liabilities at fair
value, which is defined as the price that would be
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date (exit price).

The assets and liabilities we recognize at fair
value are subject to potentially significant vola-
tility based on numerous considerations including,
but not limited to changes in commodity prices,
interest rates, maturity and timing of settlement.

Prices actively quoted on national exchanges are
used to determine the fair value of most of our
assets and liabilities recorded on our balance sheet
at fair value. Within our nonregulated operations,
we utilize a mid-market pricing convention (the
mid-point between the bid and ask prices) for
determining fair value measurement, as permitted
under current accounting standards. Values
derived from these sources reflect the market in
which transactions involving these financial
instruments are executed.

We utilize models and other valuation methods to
determine fair value when external sources are not
available. Values are adjusted to reflect the poten-
tial impact of an orderly liquidation of our posi-
tions over a reasonable period of time under then-
current market conditions.

We believe the market prices and models used to
value these financial instruments represent the
best information available with respect to the
market in which transactions involving these
financial instruments are executed, the closing

exchange and over-the-counter quotations, time

tracts.

Fair-value estimates also consider our own cred-
itworthiness and the creditworthiness of the coun-
terparties involved. Our counterparties consist
primarily of financial institutions and major
energy companies. This concentration of counter-
parties may materially impact our exposure to
credit risk resulting from market, economic or
regulatory conditions. We seek to minimize coun-
terparty credit risk through an evaluation of their
financial condition and credit ratings and the use
of collateral requirements under certain circum-
stances.
Impairment assessments . . . We review the carrying value of our long-lived
assets, including goodwill and identifiable
intangibles, whenever events or changes in
circumstance indicate that such carrying values
may not be recoverable, and at least annually for
goodwill, as required by U.S. accounting stan-
dards.

The evaluation of our goodwill balances and other
long-lived assets or identifiable assets for which
uncertainty exists regarding the recoverability of
the carrying value of such assets involves the
assessment of future cash flows and external
market conditions and other subjective factors that
could impact the estimation of future cash flows
including, but not limited to the commodity prices,
the amount and timing of future cash flows, future
growth rates and the discount rate. Unforeseen
events and changes in circumstances or market
conditions could adversely affect these estimates,
which could result in an impairment charge.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview

Atmos Energy Corporation strives to operate its businesses safely and reliably while delivering superior
shareholder value. In recent years we have implemented rate designs that reduce or eliminate regulatory lag and
separate the recovery of our approved rate from customer usage patterns. Additionally, we have significantly
increased investments in the safety and reliability of our natural gas distribution and transmission infrastructure.
This increased level of investment and timely recovery of these investments through our various regulatory
mechanisms has resulted in increased earnings and operating cash flow in recent years.

This trend continued during fiscal 2016 as net income increased to $350.1 million, or $3.38 per diluted share
for the year ended September 30, 2016, compared with net income of $315.1 million or $3.09 per diluted share in
the prior year. The year-over-year increase largely reflects positive rate outcomes, which more than offset
weather that was 25 percent warmer than the prior year and increased pipeline maintenance and integrity spend-
ing.

30

Capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 totaled $1,087.0 million. Over 80 percent was invested to improve the
safety and reliability of our distribution and transmission systems, with a significant portion of this investment
incurred under regulatory mechanisms that reduce regulatory lag to six months or less. Fiscal 2015 spending
under these and other mechanisms enabled the Company to complete 20 regulatory filings during fiscal 2016 that
should increase annual operating income from regulated operations by $122.5 million. We funded our capital
expenditure program primarily through operating cash flows of $795.0 million, net short-term borrowings and
the issuance of common stock, including the At-the-Market Equity Sales (ATM) Program described below.

As we continue to invest in the safety and reliability of our distribution and transmission systems, we expect
our capital spending will increase in future periods. We intend to fund this level of investment through available
operating cash flows, the issuance of long-term debt securities and, to a lesser extent, the issuance of equity. In
order to strengthen our ability to meet our financing needs, we:

‰ Entered into an ATM equity distribution agreement in March 2016 under which we may issue and sell
shares of our common stock, up to an aggregate offering price of $200 million. We issued 1.4 million
shares of common stock and received $98.6 million in net proceeds under the ATM program in fiscal
2016.

‰ Executed in September 2016 a new three-year, $200 million multi-draw term loan agreement with a syndi-
cate of three lenders. The term loan will be used to refinance existing indebtedness and for working capi-
tal, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes.

‰ Amended our existing five-year $1.25 billion unsecured credit facility in October 2016, which increased
the committed loan to $1.5 billion and extended the facility through September 25, 2021. The amended
facility also retains the $250 million accordion feature, which allows for an increase in the total commit-
ted loan amount to $1.75 billion.

On May 13, 2016, Standard & Poor’s Corporation upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to A from A-
and upgraded our short-term debt rating to A-1 from A-2, with a ratings outlook of stable, citing strong financial
performance largely due to our ability to timely recover capital investments.

On October 31, 2016, we announced the proposed sale of AEM to CenterPoint Energy Services, Inc. The
transaction will include the transfer of approximately 800 delivered gas customers and AEM’s related asset
optimization business at an all cash price of $40.0 million plus working capital at the date of closing. No material
gain or loss is currently anticipated in connection with the closing of this transaction. The proceeds from the sale
will be redeployed to fund infrastructure investment in the regulated business. Upon completion of the sale, we
will have fully exited the nonregulated gas marketing business.

As a result of the continued contribution and stability of our regulated earnings, cash flows and capital struc-
ture, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend by 7.1 percent for fiscal 2017.

See the following discussion regarding the results of operations for each of our business operating segments.

Regulated Distribution Segment

The primary factors that impact the results of our regulated distribution operations are our ability to earn our
authorized rates of return, the cost of natural gas, competitive factors in the energy industry and economic con-
ditions in our service areas.

Our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on our ability to improve the rate design in our
various ratemaking jurisdictions by reducing or eliminating regulatory lag and, ultimately, separating the recov-
ery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns. Improving rate design is a long-term process and is
further complicated by the fact that we operate in multiple rate jurisdictions. The “Ratemaking Activity” section
of this Form 10-K describes our current rate strategy, progress towards implementing that strategy and recent
ratemaking initiatives in more detail.

We are generally able to pass the cost of gas through to our customers without markup under purchased gas
cost adjustment mechanisms; therefore the cost of gas typically does not have an impact on our gross profit as
increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues. Accordingly, we believe gross
profit is a better indicator of our financial performance than revenues. However, gross profit in our Texas and
Mississippi service areas include franchise fees and gross receipt taxes, which are calculated as a percentage of
revenue (inclusive of gas costs). Therefore, the amount of these taxes included in revenue is influenced by the
cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes. We record the tax expense as a component of taxes, other than
income. Although changes in revenue related taxes arising from changes in gas costs affect gross profit, over
time the impact is offset within operating income.

Although the cost of gas typically does not have a direct impact on our gross profit, higher gas costs may
adversely impact our accounts receivable collections, resulting in higher bad debt expense, and may require us to
increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense. In addition, higher gas costs,
as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve
or, in the case of industrial consumers, to use alternative energy sources. Currently, gas cost risk has been miti-
gated by rate design that allows us to collect from our customers the gas cost portion of our bad debt expense on
approximately 76 percent of our residential and commercial margins.

During fiscal 2016, we completed 19 regulatory proceedings in our regulated distribution segment, which
should result in a $81.8 million increase in annual operating income.

Fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2015

Net income for our regulated distribution segment increased 13 percent, primarily due to a $35.2 million
increase in gross profit, partially offset by a $15.8 million increase in operating expenses. The year-to-date
increase in gross profit primarily reflects:

‰ a $47.5 million net increase in rate adjustments. Our Mid-Tex Division accounted for $20.9 million of this
increase. We also experienced increases in our Mississippi and West Texas Divisions.

‰ The impact of weather that was 25 percent warmer than the prior year, before adjusting for weather nor-
malization mechanisms. Therefore, although sales volumes declined 17 percent, gross margin experienced
just a $3.4 million decline from lower consumption.

‰ Customer growth, primarily in our Mid-Tex, Louisiana and Tennessee service areas, which contributed an
incremental $6.6 million.

‰ a $15.4 million decrease in revenue-related taxes primarily in our Mid-Tex and West Texas Divisions,
offset by a corresponding $16.1 million decrease in the related tax expense.

The increase in operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance expense, bad debt expense,
depreciation and amortization expense and taxes, other than income, was primarily due to pipeline maintenance
and related activities and increased depreciation expense associated with increased capital investments.

Net income for the year ended September 30, 2016 includes a $5.0 million income tax benefit for equity
awards that vested during the current year as a result of adopting the new stock-based accounting guidance, as
described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.

Fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2014

Net income for our regulated distribution segment increased 19 percent, primarily due to a $61.1 million
increase in gross profit, partially offset by a $25.5 million increase in operating expenses. The year-over-year
increase in gross profit primarily reflects:

‰ a $70.6 million net increase in rate adjustments, primarily in our Mid-Tex, West Texas, Kentucky/Mid-
States and Colorado-Kansas Divisions.

33

‰ a $4.5 million increase in transportation revenue. Transportation volumes increased one percent due to
increased economic activity experienced in our Kentucky/Mid-States Division and increased consumption
in our West Texas Division due to colder than normal weather.

‰ a $10.5 million decrease in consumption associated with an eight percent decrease in sales volumes. Fis-
cal 2015 weather was ten percent warmer compared to fiscal 2014, before adjusting for weather normal-
ization mechanisms.

‰ a $2.5 million decrease in revenue-related taxes primarily in our Mid-Tex Division.

The increase in operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance expense, bad debt expense,
depreciation and amortization expense and taxes, other than income, was primarily due to increased depreciation
expense associated with increased capital investments and increased ad valorem and franchise taxes.

Interest charges decreased by $10.8 million, primarily due to replacing our $500 million unsecured 4.95%
senior notes with $500 million of 4.125% 30-year unsecured senior notes on October 15, 2014.

The following table shows our operating income by regulated distribution division, in order of total rate
base, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The presentation of our regulated dis-
tribution operating income is included for financial reporting purposes and may not be appropriate for rate-

Regulated Pipeline Segment

Our regulated pipeline segment consists of the pipeline and storage operations of APT. APT is one of the
largest intrastate pipeline operations in Texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gas producing
areas of central, northern and eastern Texas, extending into or near the major producing areas of the Barnett
Shale, the Texas Gulf Coast and the Delaware and Val Verde Basins of West Texas. APT provides transportation
and storage services to our Mid-Tex Division, other third party local distribution companies, industrial and elec-
tric generation customers, marketers and producers. As part of its pipeline operations, APT manages five under-
ground storage reservoirs in Texas.

Our regulated pipeline segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns, competitive factors in the energy
industry and economic conditions in APT’s service area. Natural gas prices do not directly impact the results of
this segment as revenues are derived from the transportation of natural gas. However, natural gas prices and
demand for natural gas could influence the level of drilling activity in the markets that we serve, which may
influence the level of throughput we may be able to transport on our pipeline. Further, natural gas price differ-
ences between the various hubs that we serve determine the market value for transportation services between
those geographic areas.

The results of APT are also significantly impacted by the natural gas requirements of the Mid-Tex Division
because APT is the Mid-Tex Division’s primary transporter of natural gas.

Finally, as a regulated pipeline, the operations of APT may be impacted by the timing of when costs and
expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs.

Fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2015

Net income for our regulated pipeline segment increased seven percent, primarily due to a $38.7 million
increase in gross profit, partially offset by a $20.6 million increase in operating expenses. The increase in gross
profit primarily reflects a $39.6 million increase in rates from the approved 2015 and 2016 Gas Reliability Infra-
structure Program (GRIP) filings. Additionally, gross profit reflects a $3.6 million increase from the sale of
excess retention gas, which was offset by a $4.0 million decrease in through-system volumes and lower storage
and blending fees due to warmer weather in the current year compared to the prior year.

Operating expenses increased $20.6 million, primarily due to increased levels of pipeline maintenance activ-
ities to improve the safety and reliability of our system and increased property taxes and depreciation expense
associated with increased capital investments.

Fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2014

Net income for our regulated pipeline segment increased 10 percent, primarily due to a $51.7 million
increase in gross profit, partially offset by a $43.2 million increase in operating expenses. The increase in gross
profit primarily reflects a $47.0 million increase in rates from the approved 2014 and 2015 GRIP filings. Addi-
tionally, gross profit reflects increased pipeline demand fees and through-system transportation volumes and
rates that were offset by lower park and lend, storage and blending fees and the absence of a $1.8 million
increase recorded in the fiscal 2014 associated with the renewal of an annual adjustment mechanism.

Operating expenses increased $43.2 million, primarily due to increased levels of pipeline and right-of-way
maintenance activities to improve the safety and reliability of our system and increased depreciation expense
associated with increased capital investments, along with the absence of a $6.7 million refund received in fiscal
2014 as a result of the completion of a state use tax audit.

Nonregulated Segment

Our nonregulated operations are conducted through Atmos Energy Holdings, Inc. (AEH), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Atmos Energy Corporation and typically represent approximately five percent of our consolidated
net income.

AEH’s primary business is to buy, sell and deliver natural gas at competitive prices to approximately 1,000
customers located primarily in the Midwest and Southeast areas of the United States. AEH accomplishes this
objective by aggregating and purchasing gas supply, arranging transportation and storage logistics and effectively
managing commodity price risk.

AEH also earns storage and transportation demand fees primarily from our regulated distribution operations
in Louisiana and Kentucky. These demand fees are subject to regulatory oversight and are renewed periodically.

Our nonregulated activities are significantly influenced by competitive factors in the industry and general
economic conditions. Therefore, the margins earned from these activities are dependent upon our ability to attract
and retain customers and to minimize the cost of buying, selling and delivering natural gas to offer more com-
petitive pricing to those customers.

Further, natural gas market conditions, most notably the price of natural gas and the level of price volatility,
affect our nonregulated businesses. Natural gas prices and the level of volatility are influenced by a number of
factors including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, the demand for natural gas in different parts of
the country, domestic natural gas production and natural gas inventory levels.

Natural gas prices can influence:

‰ The demand for natural gas. Higher prices may cause customers to conserve or use alternative energy
sources. Conversely, lower prices could cause customers such as electric power generators to switch from
alternative energy sources to natural gas.

‰ Collection of accounts receivable from customers, which could affect the level of bad debt expense recog-
nized by this segment.

‰ The level of borrowings under our credit facilities, which affects the amount of interest expense recog-
nized by this segment.

Natural gas price volatility can also influence our nonregulated business in the following ways:

‰ Price volatility influences basis differentials, which provide opportunities to profit from identifying the
lowest cost alternative among the natural gas supplies, transportation and markets to which we have
access.

‰ Increased or decreased volatility impacts the amounts of unrealized margins recorded in our gross profit
and could impact the amount of cash required to collateralize our risk management liabilities.

Our nonregulated segment manages its exposure to natural gas commodity price risk through a combination
of physical storage and financial instruments. Therefore, results for this segment include unrealized gains or
losses on its net physical gas position and the related financial instruments used to manage commodity price risk.
These margins fluctuate based upon changes in the spreads between the physical and forward natural gas prices.
The magnitude of the unrealized gains and losses is also contingent upon the levels of our net physical position at
the end of the reporting period.

Fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2015

Net income for our nonregulated segment increased 3 percent compared to the prior year due to both lower
gross profit and lower operating expenses.

The $9.1 million period-over-period decrease in gross profit was primarily due to a $12.7 million decrease
in realized margins combined with a $3.7 million increase in unrealized margins. The decrease in realized mar-
gins reflects:

‰ A $10.3 million decrease in other realized margins. As a result of warmer weather, we modified storage
positions to meet customer needs throughout the winter and captured less favorable spread values on the
related supply repurchases. Additionally, we experienced an increase in storage demand fees related
primarily to higher park and loan activity.

‰ A $2.3 million decrease in gas delivery and related services margins, primarily due to a three percent
decrease in consolidated sales volumes due to warmer weather. However, lower net transportation costs
and other variable costs driven by fewer deliveries resulted in per-unit margins of 12 cents per Mcf, which
is consistent with prior year per-unit margins.

Operating expenses decreased $8.1 million, primarily due to lower administrative expenses.

Fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2014

Net income for our nonregulated segment decreased 51 percent from compared to fiscal 2014 due to lower
gross profit and higher operating expenses.

37

The $15.1 million year-over-year decrease in gross profit was primarily due to a $12.0 million decrease in
unrealized margins combined with a $3.1 million decrease in realized margins. The decrease in realized margins
reflects:

‰ An $11.4 million decrease in other realized margins primarily due to lower natural gas price volatility. In
fiscal 2014, strong market demand caused by significantly colder-than-normal weather resulted in
increased market volatility. These market conditions created the opportunity to accelerate physical with-
drawals that had been planned for future periods in the fiscal 2014 second quarter to capture incremental
gross profit margin. Market conditions in fiscal 2015 were less volatile than fiscal 2014, which provided
fewer opportunities to capture incremental gross profit.

‰ A $9.4 million increase in gas delivery and related services margins, primarily due to an increase in per-
unit margins from 9 cents to 12 cents per Mcf, partially offset by a seven percent decrease in consolidated
sales volumes. AEH elected not to renew excess transportation capacity in certain markets in late fiscal
2014 and early fiscal 2015. As a result, AEH experienced fewer deliveries to low-margin marketing and
power generation customers during fiscal 2015, which was the primary driver for the decrease in con-
solidated sales volumes and higher per-unit margins.

Operating expenses increased $8.9 million, primarily due to higher legal expenses as a result of the favor-
able settlement in fiscal 2014 of the Kentucky litigation and the resolution of the Tennessee Business License
Tax matter.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The liquidity required to fund our working capital, capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided
from a variety of sources, including internally generated funds as well as borrowings under our commercial paper
program and bank credit facilities. Additionally, we have various uncommitted trade credit lines with our gas
suppliers that we utilize to purchase natural gas on a monthly basis. Finally, from time to time, we raise funds
from the public debt and equity capital markets to fund our liquidity needs.

We regularly evaluate our funding strategy and capital structure to ensure that we (i) have sufficient liquid-
ity for our short-term and long-term needs and (ii) maintain a balanced capital structure with a debt-to-
capitalization ratio in a target range of 45 to 55 percent. We also evaluate the levels of committed borrowing
capacity that we require. We currently have over $1 billion of committed capacity from our short-term facilities.

As we continue to invest in the safety and reliability of our distribution and transportation system, we expect
our capital spending will increase. We intend to fund this additional investment through available operating cash
flows, the issuance of long-term debt securities and, to a lesser extent, the issuance of equity. We believe the
liquidity provided by these sources combined with our committed credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our
working capital needs and capital expenditure program for fiscal year 2017 and beyond.

To support our capital market activities, we filed a registration statement with the SEC on March 28, 2016
to issue, from time to time, up to $2.5 billion in common stock and/or debt securities, which replaced our
registration statement that expired on March 28, 2016. On March 28, 2016, we entered into an ATM equity dis-
tribution agreement under which we may issue and sell, shares of our common stock, up to an aggregate offering
price of $200 million. The shares will be issued under our shelf registration statement. Proceeds from the ATM
program will be used primarily to repay short-term debt outstanding under our $1.25 billion commercial paper
program, to fund capital spending primarily to enhance the safety and reliability of our system and for general
corporate purposes. During fiscal 2016, we issued 1.4 million shares of common stock and received $98.6 mil-
lion in net proceeds under the ATM program. At September 30, 2016, $2.4 billion of securities remain available
for issuance under the shelf registration statement.

On September 22, 2016, we entered into a three year, $200 million multi-draw term loan agreement with a
syndicate of three lenders. The term loan will be used to refinance existing indebtedness and for working capital,
capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. At September 30, 2016, there were no borrowings
under the term loan. On October 5, 2016, we amended our existing five-year $1.25 billion credit facility, which
increased the committed loan to $1.5 billion and extended the facility through September 25, 2021. The amended

38

facility also retains the $250 million accordion feature, which allows for an increase in the total committed loan
amount to $1.75 billion.

Additionally, we plan to issue new unsecured senior notes to replace $250 million and $450 million of
unsecured senior notes that will mature in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2019. During fiscal 2014 and 2015, we entered
into forward starting interest rate swaps to fix the Treasury yield component associated with the anticipated fiscal
2019 issuances at 3.782%. In fiscal 2012, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps to fix the Treasury
yield component associated with the anticipated fiscal 2017 issuances at 3.367%.

Cash Flows

Our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors, some of which we
cannot control. These factors include regulatory changes, the price for our services, the demand for such products
and services, margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices, operational risks and
other factors.

Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015
and 2014 are presented below.

Cash flows from operating activities

Year-over-year changes in our operating cash flows primarily are attributable to changes in net income,
working capital changes, particularly within our regulated distribution segment resulting from changes in the
price of natural gas and the timing of customer collections, payments for natural gas purchases and deferred gas
cost recoveries.

39

Fiscal Year ended September 30, 2016 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2015

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, we generated operating cash flows of $795.0 million com-
pared with $811.9 million in the prior year. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the timing of deferred
gas cost recoveries.

Fiscal Year ended September 30, 2015 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2014

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, we generated operating cash flows of $811.9 million com-
pared with $732.8 million in fiscal 2014. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects successful rate case
outcomes in fiscal 2014, the timing of gas cost recoveries under our purchased gas cost mechanisms and lower
gas prices during the fiscal 2015 storage injection season.

Cash flows from investing activities

In recent years, we have used substantial amounts of cash to fund our ongoing construction program, which
enables us to enhance the safety and reliability of the systems used to provide regulated distribution services to
our existing customer base, expand our natural gas distribution services into new markets, enhance the integrity
of our pipelines and, more recently, expand our intrastate pipeline network. Over the last three fiscal years,
approximately 80 percent of our capital spending has been committed to improving the safety and reliability of
our system.

In executing our regulatory strategy, we target our capital spending on regulatory mechanisms that permit us
to earn an adequate return timely on our investment without compromising the safety or reliability of our system.
Substantially all of our regulated jurisdictions have rate tariffs that provide the opportunity to include in their rate
base approved capital costs on a periodic basis without being required to file a rate case.

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, we incurred $1,087.0 million for capital expenditures com-
pared with $963.6 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 and $824.4 million for the fiscal year
ended September 30, 2014.

Fiscal Year ended September 30, 2016 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2015

The $123.4 million increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily
reflects:

‰ A $69.5 million increase in capital spending in our regulated distribution segment, which reflects the
repair and replacement of our transmission and distribution pipelines as part of a planned increase in
safety and reliability investment in fiscal 2016, the installation and replacement of measurement and regu-
lating equipment and other pipeline integrity projects.

‰ A $54.8 million increase in capital spending in our regulated pipeline segment, primarily related to the
enhancement and fortification of two storage fields to ensure the reliability of gas service to our Mid-Tex
Division.

Fiscal Year ended September 30, 2015 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2014

The $139.2 million increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily
reflects:

‰ A $96.2 million increase in capital spending in our regulated distribution segment, which primarily
reflects a planned increase in safety and reliability investment in fiscal 2015.

‰ A $43.4 million increase in capital spending in our regulated pipeline segment, primarily related to the
enhancement and fortification of two storage fields to ensure the reliability of gas service to our Mid-Tex
Division.

Cash flows from financing activities

We generated a net $303.6 million, $131.1 million and $68.2 million in cash from financing activities for
fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014. Our significant financing activities for the fiscal years ended September 30,
2016, 2015 and 2014 are summarized as follows:

2016

During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, our financing activities generated $303.6 million of cash
compared with $131.1 million of cash generated in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to higher net
short-term borrowings due to increased capital expenditures and period-over-period changes in working capital
funding needs compared to the prior year, as well as proceeds received from the issuance of common stock under
our ATM program in the third fiscal quarter of 2016.

2015

During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, our financing activities generated $131.1 million of cash
compared with $68.2 million of cash generated in fiscal 2014. The increase is primarily due to timing between
short-term debt borrowings and repayments during fiscal 2015, proceeds from the issuance of $500 million
unsecured 4.125% senior notes in October 2014 and the settlement of the associated forward starting interest rate
swaps. Partially offsetting these increases were the repayment of $500 million 4.95% senior unsecured notes at
maturity on October 15, 2014, compared with short-term debt borrowings and repayments in fiscal 2014 and
proceeds generated from the equity offering completed in February 2014.

2014

During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, our financing activities generated $68.2 million of cash
compared with $85.7 million of cash generated in fiscal 2013. The decrease is primarily due to timing between
short-term debt borrowings and repayments during fiscal 2014, partially offset by proceeds from the equity offer-
ing completed in February 2014 compared with proceeds generated from the issuance of long-term debt in fiscal
2013.

The increase in the number of shares issued in fiscal 2016 compared with the number of shares issued in
fiscal 2015 primarily reflects shares issued under the ATM program. At September 30, 2016, of the 11.2 million
shares authorized for issuance from the LTIP, 2,359,106 shares remained available.

The decrease in the number of shares issued in fiscal 2015 compared with the number of shares issued in
fiscal 2014 primarily reflects the equity offering completed in February 2014, partially offset by the fact that we
began issuing shares for use by the Direct Stock Purchase Plan and the Retirement Savings Plan and Trust rather
than using shares purchased in the open market. For the year ended September 30, 2015, we canceled and retired
148,464 shares attributable to federal income tax withholdings on equity awards which are not included in the
table above.

Credit Facilities

Our short-term borrowing requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of the natural gas business.
Changes in the price of natural gas and the amount of natural gas we need to supply to meet our customers’ needs
could significantly affect our borrowing requirements.

As of September 30, 2016, we financed our short-term borrowing requirements through a combination of a
$1.25 billion commercial paper program, four committed revolving credit facilities and one uncommitted revolv-
ing credit facility, with a total availability from third-party lenders of approximately $1.3 billion of working capi-
tal funding. On October 5, 2016, we amended our existing $1.25 billion unsecured credit facility which increased
the committed loan to $1.5 billion and extended the facility through September 25, 2021. The amended facility
also retains the $250 million accordion feature, which provides the opportunity to increase the total committed
loan amount to $1.75 billion. We also use intercompany credit facilities to supplement the funding provided by
these third-party committed credit facilities.

Shelf Registration

On March 28, 2016, we filed a registration statement with the SEC that originally permitted us to issue,
from time to time, up to $2.5 billion in common stock and/or debt securities, which replaced our registration
statement that expired on March 28, 2016. At September 30, 2016, $2.4 billion of securities remain available for
issuance under the shelf registration statement.

Credit Ratings

Our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain short-term and long-term financing, in addition to the
cost of such financing. In determining our credit ratings, the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative
factors, including debt to total capitalization, operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt, operating cash
flow coverage of interest and pension liabilities and funding status. In addition, the rating agencies consider qual-
itative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time, the quality of our management and business strat-
egy, the risks associated with our regulated and nonregulated businesses and the regulatory environment in the
states where we operate.

Our debt is rated by three rating agencies: Standard & Poor’s Corporation (S&P), Moody’s Investors Serv-
ice (Moody’s) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch). On May 13, 2016, S&P upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to A
from A- and upgraded our short-term debt rating to A-1 from A-2, with a ratings outlook of stable, citing strong
financial performance largely due to our ability to timely recover capital investments. As of September 30, 2016,
all three rating agencies maintained a stable outlook.

Our current debt ratings are all considered investment grade and are as follows:

S&P Moody’s

Fitch

P-1

A
F-2

A significant degradation in our operating performance or a significant reduction in our liquidity caused by
more limited access to the private and public credit markets as a result of deteriorating global or national finan-
cial and credit conditions could trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit
ratings by the three credit rating agencies. This would mean more limited access to the private and public credit
markets and an increase in the costs of such borrowings.

A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. The highest investment grade credit
rating is AAA for S&P, Aaa for Moody’s and AAA for Fitch. The lowest investment grade credit rating is BBB-
for S&P, Baa3 for Moody’s and BBB- for Fitch. Our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by
the rating agencies, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. There can be no
assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered, or
withdrawn entirely, by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant.

(4) Represents third party contractual demand fees for contracted storage in our nonregulated segment. Con-
tractual demand fees for contracted storage for our regulated distribution segment are excluded as these costs
are fully recoverable through our purchase gas adjustment mechanisms.
(5) Represents third party contractual demand fees for transportation in our nonregulated segment.
(6) Represents liabilities for natural gas commodity and interest rate financial instruments that were valued as of
September 30, 2016. The ultimate settlement amounts of these remaining liabilities are unknown because
they are subject to continuing market risk until the financial instruments are settled.
(7) Represents expected contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans, which are discussed in
Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.
(8) Represents liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions claimed or expected to be claimed on tax
returns.
Our regulated distribution segment maintains supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a
period of up to one year. Commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a
monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices. Commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as
necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of individual contracts. Our Mid-Tex Division also
maintains a limited number of long-term supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of gas for our customers in
its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market and fixed prices. At September 30,
2016, we were committed to purchase 28.5 Bcf within one year, 4.2 Bcf within two to three years and 0.6 Bcf
after three years under indexed contracts.
AEH has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural gas under contracts indexed to the forward
NYMEX strip or fixed price contracts. At September 30, 2016, AEH was committed to purchase 93.5 Bcf within

43

one year, 9.1 Bcf within two to three years and 0.2 Bcf after three years under indexed contracts. AEH is commit-
ted to purchase 11.9 Bcf within one year and 1.3 Bcf within two to three years under fixed price contracts with
prices ranging from $0.25 to $3.16 per Mcf.

Risk Management Activities
As discussed above in our Critical Accounting Policies, we use financial instruments to mitigate commodity
price risk and, periodically, to manage interest rate risk. We conduct risk management activities through our regu-
lated distribution and nonregulated segments. In our regulated distribution segment, we use a combination of phys-
ical storage, fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large winter-
period gas price increases. In our nonregulated segments, we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price
changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial instruments, including
futures, over-the-counter and exchange-traded options and swap contracts with counterparties. To the extent our
inventory cost and actual sales and actual purchases do not correlate with the changes in the market indices we use
in our hedges, we could experience ineffectiveness or the hedges may no longer meet the accounting requirements
for hedge accounting, resulting in the financial instruments being marked to market through earnings.
We record our financial instruments as a component of risk management assets and liabilities, which are
classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying financial instru-
ment. Substantially all of our financial instruments are valued using external market quotes and indices.

Employee Benefits Programs

An important element of our total compensation program, and a significant component of our operation and
maintenance expense, is the offering of various benefits programs to our employees. These programs include
medical and dental insurance coverage and pension and postretirement programs.

Medical and Dental Insurance

We offer medical and dental insurance programs to substantially all of our employees. We believe these
programs are compliant with all current and future provisions that will be going into effect under The Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act and consistent with other programs in our industry. In recent years, we have
endeavored to actively manage our health care costs through the introduction of a wellness strategy that is
focused on helping employees to identify health risks and to manage these risks through improved lifestyle
choices.

Over the last five fiscal years, we have experienced annual medical and prescription inflation of approx-
imately six percent. For fiscal 2017, we anticipate the medical and prescription drug inflation rate will continue
at approximately six percent, primarily due to the inflation of health care costs.

Net Periodic Pension and Postretirement Benefit Costs

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, our total net periodic pension and other benefits costs was
$46.0 million, compared with $58.9 million and $69.8 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and
2014. These costs relating to our regulated distribution operations are recoverable through our distribution rates.
A portion of these costs is capitalized into our distribution rate base, and the remaining costs are recorded as a
component of operation and maintenance expense.

Our fiscal 2016 costs were determined using a September 30, 2015 measurement date. At that date, interest
and corporate bond rates utilized to determine our discount rates were higher than the interest and corporate bond
rates as of September 30, 2014, the measurement date for our fiscal 2015 net periodic cost. Therefore, we
increased the discount rate used to measure our fiscal 2016 net periodic cost from 4.43 percent to 4.55 percent.
We lowered expected return on plan assets from 7.25 percent to 7.00 percent in the determination of our fiscal
2016 net periodic pension cost based upon expected market returns for our targeted asset allocation. As a result
of the net impact of these and other assumptions, our fiscal 2016 pension and postretirement medical costs were
approximately 20 percent lower than in the prior year.

Our fiscal 2015 costs were determined using a September 30, 2014 measurement date. At that date, interest
and corporate bond rates utilized to determine our discount rates were lower than the interest and corporate bond
rates as of September 30, 2013, the measurement date for our fiscal 2014 net periodic cost. Therefore, we
decreased the discount rate used to measure our fiscal 2015 net periodic cost from 4.95 percent to 4.43 percent.
We maintained our expected return on plan assets at 7.25 percent in the determination of our fiscal 2015 net
periodic pension cost based upon expected market returns for our targeted asset allocation. As a result of the net
impact of these and other assumptions, our fiscal 2015 pension and postretirement medical costs were lower than
in the prior year.

Pension and Postretirement Plan Funding

Generally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that will at least equal the minimum
amount required to comply with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). However,
additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered necessary. Contributions are
intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in
the future.

In accordance with the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA), we determined the funded status of our plans
as of January 1, 2016. Based on this valuation, we contributed cash of $15.0 million, $38.0 million and $27.1
million to our pension plans during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014. Each contribution increased the level of our plan
assets to achieve a desired PPA funding threshold.

We contributed $16.6 million, $20.0 million and $23.6 million to our postretirement benefits plans for the
fiscal years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The contributions represent the portion of the postretire-
ment costs we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum funding required by state regulatory
commissions.

Outlook for Fiscal 2017 and Beyond

As of September 30, 2016, interest and corporate bond rates were lower than the rates as of September 30,
2015. Therefore, we decreased the discount rate used to measure our fiscal 2017 net periodic cost from 4.55
percent to 3.73 percent. We maintained the expected return on plan assets of 7.00 percent in the determination of
our fiscal 2017 net periodic pension cost based upon expected market returns for our targeted asset allocation. On
October 20, 2016, the Society of Actuaries released its annually-updated mortality improvement scale for pen-
sion plans incorporating new assumptions surrounding life expectancies in the United States. As of September
30, 2016, we updated our assumed mortality rates to incorporate the updated mortality table. As a result of the
net impact of changes in these and other assumptions, we expect our fiscal 2017 net periodic pension cost to be
consistent with fiscal 2016.

Based upon current market conditions, the current funded position of the plans and the funding requirements
under the PPA, we do not anticipate a minimum required contribution for fiscal 2017. However, we may consider
whether a voluntary contribution is prudent to maintain certain funding levels. With respect to our postretirement
medical plans, we anticipate contributing between $10 million and $20 million during fiscal 2017.

Actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual and expected
return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension costs ultimately recognized. A 0.25
percent change in our discount rate would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately $2.9
million. A 0.25 percent change in our expected rate of return would impact our pension and postretirement costs
by approximately $1.3 million.

The projected liability, future funding requirements and the amount of expense or income recognized for
each of our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are subject to change, depending on the actuarial
value of plan assets, and the determination of future benefit obligations as of each subsequent calculation
date. These amounts are impacted by actual investment returns, changes in interest rates, changes in the demo-
graphic composition of the participants in the plans and other actuarial assumptions.

RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

Recent accounting developments and their impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash
flows are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.

46

ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

We are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates. Commodity price risk is the
potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a particular instrument or commodity.
Interest-rate risk results from our portfolio of debt and equity instruments that we issue to provide financing and
liquidity for our business activities.

We conduct risk management activities through both our regulated distribution and nonregulated segments.
In our regulated distribution segment, we use a combination of physical storage, fixed physical contracts and
fixed financial contracts to protect us and our customers against unusually large winter period gas price
increases. In our nonregulated segment, we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock
in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial instruments including futures, over-the-
counter and exchange-traded options and swap contracts with counterparties. Our risk management activities and
related accounting treatment are described in further detail in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.
Additionally, our earnings are affected by changes in short-term interest rates as a result of our issuance of short-
term commercial paper and our other short-term borrowings.

Commodity Price Risk

Regulated distribution segment

We purchase natural gas for our regulated distribution operations. Substantially all of the costs of gas pur-
chased for regulated distribution operations are recovered from our customers through purchased gas cost
adjustment mechanisms. Therefore, our regulated distribution operations have limited commodity price risk
exposure.

Nonregulated segment

Our nonregulated segment is also exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural
gas. For our nonregulated segment, we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate commodity price risk. For purposes
of this analysis, we estimate commodity price risk by applying a $0.50 change in the forward NYMEX price to
our net open position (including existing storage and related financial contracts) at the end of each period. Based
on AEH’s net open position (including existing storage and related financial contracts) at September 30, 2016 of
0.1 Bcf, a $0.50 change in the forward NYMEX price would have had an impact of less than $0.1 million on our
consolidated net income.

Changes in the difference between the indices used to mark to market our physical inventory (Gas Daily)
and the related fair-value hedge (NYMEX) can result in volatility in our reported net income; but, over time,
gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory will be offset by gains and losses on the fair-value hedges.
Based upon our net physical position at September 30, 2016 and assuming our hedges would still qualify as
highly effective, a $0.50 change in the difference between the Gas Daily and NYMEX indices would impact our
reported net income by approximately $5.9 million.

Additionally, these changes could cause us to recognize a risk management liability, which would require us
to place cash into an escrow account to collateralize this liability position. This, in turn, would reduce the amount
of cash we would have on hand to fund our working capital needs.

Interest Rate Risk

Our earnings are exposed to changes in short-term interest rates associated with our short-term commercial
paper program and other short-term borrowings. We use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our short-term interest
rate risk. For purposes of this analysis, we estimate our short-term interest rate risk as the difference between our
actual interest expense for the period and estimated interest expense for the period assuming a hypothetical aver-
age one percent increase in the interest rates associated with our short-term borrowings. Had interest rates asso-
ciated with our short-term borrowings increased by an average of one percent, our interest expense would have
increased by approximately $6.4 million during 2016.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Atmos Energy Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Atmos Energy Corporation as of Sep-
tember 30, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, share-
holders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2016. Our audits
also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 8. These financial statements and
schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assess-
ing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the con-
solidated financial position of Atmos Energy Corporation at September 30, 2016 and 2015, and the consolidated
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2016, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial state-
ment schedule, when considered in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects the financial information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), Atmos Energy Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016,
based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November 14, 2016
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Dallas, Texas, and our customer support centers are located in Amarillo and Waco, Texas.

Our regulated pipeline business, which is also subject to federal and state regulation, consists of the regu-
lated operations of our Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division, a division of the Company. This division transports
natural gas to our Mid-Tex Division, transports natural gas for third parties and manages five underground stor-
age reservoirs in Texas. We also provide ancillary services customary to the pipeline industry including parking
arrangements, lending and sales of inventory on hand.

Our nonregulated businesses operate primarily in the Midwest and Southeast through various wholly-owned
subsidiaries of Atmos Energy Holdings, Inc., (AEH). AEH is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and
based in Houston, Texas. Through AEH, we provide natural gas management and transportation services to
municipalities, regulated distribution companies, including certain divisions of Atmos Energy and third parties.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of consolidation — The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Atmos Energy Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany transactions have been
eliminated; however, we have not eliminated intercompany profits when such amounts are probable of recovery
under the affiliates’ rate regulation process.

Basis of comparison — As described under Recent Accounting Pronouncements below, we reclassified
debt issuance costs from deferred charges and other assets to long-term debt. Additionally, we recorded immate-
rial corrections to the presentation of certain activities on our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the years
ended September 30, 2015 and 2014.

Use of estimates — The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles gen-
erally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. The most significant estimates include the allow-
ance for doubtful accounts, unbilled revenues, contingency accruals, pension and postretirement obligations,
deferred income taxes, impairment of long-lived assets, risk management and trading activities, fair value meas-
urements and the valuation of goodwill and other long-lived assets. Actual results could differ from those esti-
mates.

Regulation — Our regulated distribution and regulated pipeline operations are subject to regulation with
respect to rates, service, maintenance of accounting records and various other matters by the respective regu-
latory authorities in the states in which we operate. Our accounting policies recognize the financial effects of the
ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory commissions. Accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States require cost-based, rate-regulated entities that meet certain criteria to
reflect the authorized recovery of costs due to regulatory decisions in their financial statements. As a result, cer-
tain costs that would normally be expensed under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
are permitted to be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet because it is probable they can be recovered
through rates. Further, regulation may impact the period in which revenues or expenses are recognized. The
amounts to be recovered or recognized are based upon historical experience and our understanding of the regu-
lations.

We record regulatory assets as a component of other current assets and deferred charges and other assets for
costs that have been deferred for which future recovery through customer rates is considered probable. Regu-
latory liabilities are recorded either on the face of the balance sheet or as a component of current liabilities,
deferred income taxes or deferred credits and other liabilities when it is probable that revenues will be reduced
for amounts that will be credited to customers through the ratemaking process. Significant regulatory assets and
liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 included the following:

Revenue recognition — Sales of natural gas to our regulated distribution customers are billed on a monthly
basis; however, the billing cycle periods for certain classes of customers do not necessarily coincide with
accounting periods used for financial reporting purposes. We follow the revenue accrual method of accounting

56

ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

for regulated distribution segment revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas delivered to customers, but not
yet billed under the cycle billing method, are estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to expense.

On occasion, we are permitted to implement new rates that have not been formally approved by our state
regulatory commissions, which are subject to refund. As permitted by accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States, we recognize this revenue and establish a reserve for amounts that could be refunded based on
our experience for the jurisdiction in which the rates were implemented.

Rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for increases and decreases in our purchased gas
costs through purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms. Purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms provide
gas distribution companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate
case to address all of their non-gas costs. There is no gross profit generated through purchased gas cost adjust-
ments, but they provide a dollar-for-dollar offset to increases or decreases in our regulated distribution segment’s
gas costs. The effects of these purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms are recorded as deferred gas costs on
our balance sheet.

Operating revenues for our regulated pipeline and nonregulated segments are recognized in the period in
which actual volumes are transported and storage services are provided.

Operating revenues for our nonregulated segment and the associated carrying value of natural gas inventory
(inclusive of storage costs) are recognized when we sell the gas and physically deliver it to our customers.
Operating revenues include realized gains and losses arising from the settlement of financial instruments used in
our nonregulated activities.

Cash and cash equivalents — We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three
months or less to be cash equivalents.

Accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts — Accounts receivable arise from natural gas
sales to residential, commercial, industrial, municipal and other customers. We establish an allowance for doubt-
ful accounts to reduce the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to collect based on our col-
lection experience or where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability or reluctance to pay. However, if
circumstances change, our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be affected. Circumstances
which could affect our estimates include, but are not limited to, customer credit issues, the level of natural gas
prices, customer deposits and general economic conditions. Accounts are written off once they are deemed to be
uncollectible.

Gas stored underground — Our gas stored underground is comprised of natural gas injected into storage to
support the winter season withdrawals for our regulated distribution operations and natural gas held by our non-
regulated segment to conduct their operations. The average cost method is used for substantially all of our regu-
lated operations. Our nonregulated segment utilizes the average cost method; however, most of this inventory is
hedged and is therefore reported at fair value at the end of each month. Gas in storage that is retained as cushion
gas to maintain reservoir pressure is classified as property, plant and equipment and is valued at cost.

Regulated property, plant and equipment — Regulated property, plant and equipment is stated at original
cost, net of contributions in aid of construction. The cost of additions includes direct construction costs, payroll
related costs (taxes, pensions and other fringe benefits), administrative and general costs and an allowance for
funds used during construction. The allowance for funds used during construction represents the estimated cost
of funds used to finance the construction of major projects and are capitalized in the rate base for ratemaking
purposes when the completed projects are placed in service. Interest expense of $2.8 million, $2.3 million and
$1.5 million was capitalized in 2016, 2015 and 2014.

Major renewals, including replacement pipe, and betterments that are recoverable under our regulatory rate
base are capitalized while the costs of maintenance and repairs that are not recoverable through rates are charged
to expense as incurred. The costs of large projects are accumulated in construction in progress until the project is

57

ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

completed. When the project is completed, tested and placed in service, the balance is transferred to the regulated
plant in service account included in the rate base and depreciation begins.
Regulated property, plant and equipment is depreciated at various rates on a straight-line basis. These rates
are approved by our regulatory commissions and are comprised of two components: one based on average serv-
ice life and one based on cost of removal. Accordingly, we recognize our cost of removal expense as a compo-
nent of depreciation expense. The related cost of removal accrual is reflected as a regulatory liability on the
consolidated balance sheet. At the time property, plant and equipment is retired, removal expenses less salvage,
are charged to the regulatory cost of removal accrual. The composite depreciation rate was 3.2 percent for the
fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, and 3.3 percent for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and
2014.
Nonregulated property, plant and equipment — Nonregulated property, plant and equipment is stated at
cost. Depreciation is generally computed on the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes based upon
estimated useful lives ranging from three to 43 years.
Asset retirement obligations — We record a liability at fair value for an asset retirement obligation when
the legal obligation to retire the asset has been incurred with an offsetting increase to the carrying value of the
related asset. Accretion of the asset retirement obligation due to the passage of time is recorded as an operating
expense.
As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had asset retirement obligations of $13.4 million and $11.1 million.
Additionally, we had $8.1 million and $4.8 million of asset retirement costs recorded as a component of property,
plant and equipment that will be depreciated over the remaining life of the underlying associated assets.
We believe we have a legal obligation to retire our natural gas storage facilities. However, we have not
recognized an asset retirement obligation associated with our storage facilities because we are not able to
determine the settlement date of this obligation as we do not anticipate taking our storage facilities out of service
permanently. Therefore, we cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of this obligation.
Impairment of long-lived assets — We periodically evaluate whether events or circumstances have
occurred that indicate that other long-lived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may
warrant revision. When such events or circumstances are present, we assess the recoverability of long-lived
assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected future cash flows. In the
event the sum of the expected future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset is less than the carrying value
of the asset, an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value is recorded.
Goodwill — We annually evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment during our second fiscal quarter or
more frequently as impairment indicators arise. We use a present value technique based on discounted cash flows
to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. These calculations are dependent on several subjective factors
including the timing of future cash flows, future growth rates and the discount rate. An impairment charge is
recognized if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its fair value.
Marketable securities — As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, all of our marketable securities were classi-
fied as available for sale. In accordance with the authoritative accounting standards, these securities are reported
at market value with unrealized gains and losses shown as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss). We regularly evaluate the performance of these investments on an individual investment by
investment basis for impairment, taking into consideration the fund’s purpose, volatility and current returns. If a
determination is made that a decline in fair value is other than temporary, the related investment is written down
to its estimated fair value.
Financial instruments and hedging activities — We use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price
risk in our regulated distribution and nonregulated segments and interest rate risk. The objectives and strategies
for using financial instruments have been tailored to our regulated and nonregulated businesses and are discussed
in Note 13.

58

ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

We record all of our financial instruments on the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in fair value ulti-
mately recorded in the income statement. These financial instruments are reported as risk management assets and
liabilities and are classified as current or noncurrent other assets or liabilities based upon the anticipated settle-
ment date of the underlying financial instrument. We record the cash flow impact of our financial instruments in
operating cash flows based upon their balance sheet classification.

The timing of when changes in fair value of our financial instruments are recorded in the income statement
depends on whether the financial instrument has been designated and qualifies as a part of a hedging relationship
or if regulatory rulings require a different accounting treatment. Changes in fair value for financial instruments
that do not meet one of these criteria are recognized in the income statement as they occur.

Financial Instruments Associated with Commodity Price Risk

In our regulated distribution segment, the costs associated with and the gains and losses arising from the use
of financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk are included in our purchased gas cost adjustment
mechanisms in accordance with regulatory requirements. Therefore, changes in the fair value of these financial
instruments are initially recorded as a component of deferred gas costs and recognized in the consolidated state-
ment of income as a component of purchased gas cost when the related costs are recovered through our rates and
recognized in revenue in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Accord-
ingly, there is no earnings impact on our regulated distribution segment as a result of the use of financial instru-
ments.

In our nonregulated segment, we have designated most of the natural gas inventory held by this operating
segment as the hedged item in a fair-value hedge. This inventory is marked to market at the end of each month
based on the Gas Daily index, with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in purchased
gas cost in the period of change. The financial instruments associated with this natural gas inventory have been
designated as fair-value hedges and are marked to market each month based upon the NYMEX price with
changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in purchased gas cost in the period of change. We
have elected to exclude this spot/forward differential for purposes of assessing the effectiveness of these fair-
value hedges. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we included unrealized gains
(losses) on open contracts of $1.3 million, $(2.4) million and $9.6 million as a component of nonregulated pur-
chased gas cost.

Additionally, we have elected to treat fixed-price forward contracts used in our nonregulated segment to
deliver natural gas as normal purchases and normal sales. As such, these deliveries are recorded on an accrual
basis in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. Financial instruments used to mitigate the commodity
price risk associated with these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases and
sales at indexed prices. Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses on these open financial instruments are recorded
as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, and are recognized in earnings as a component of
purchased gas cost when the hedged volumes are sold.

Gains and losses from hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in the income statement. Fair value and cash
flow hedge ineffectiveness arising from natural gas market price differences between the locations of the hedged
inventory and the delivery location specified in the financial instruments is referred to as basis ineffectiveness.
Ineffectiveness arising from changes in the fair value of the fair value hedges due to changes in the difference
between the spot price and the futures price, as well as the difference between the timing of the settlement of the
futures and the valuation of the underlying physical commodity is referred to as timing ineffectiveness. Hedge
ineffectiveness, to the extent incurred, is reported as a component of purchased gas cost.

Our nonregulated segment also utilizes master netting agreements with significant counterparties that allow
us to offset gains and losses arising from financial instruments that may be settled in cash with gains and losses
arising from financial instruments that may be settled with the physical commodity. Assets and liabilities from

59

ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

risk management activities, as well as accounts receivable and payable, reflect the master netting agreements in
place. Additionally, the accounting guidance for master netting arrangements requires us to include the fair value
of cash collateral or the obligation to return cash in the amounts that have been netted under master netting
agreements used to offset gains and losses arising from financial instruments. As of September 30, 2016 and
2015, the Company netted $24.7 million and $43.5 million of cash held in margin accounts into its current and
noncurrent risk management assets and liabilities.

Financial Instruments Associated with Interest Rate Risk

We manage interest rate risk, primarily when we plan to issue new long-term debt or to refinance existing
long-term debt. We currently manage this risk through the use of forward starting interest rate swaps to fix the
Treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with anticipated financings. We designate these finan-
cial instruments as cash flow hedges at the time the agreements are executed. Unrealized gains and losses asso-
ciated with the instruments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
When the instruments settle, the realized gain or loss is recorded as a component of accumulated other compre-
hensive income (loss) and recognized as a component of interest expense over the life of the related financing
arrangement. Hedge ineffectiveness to the extent incurred is reported as a component of interest expense. As of
September 30, 2016, the Company netted $25.7 million of cash held in margin accounts into its current and
noncurrent risk management liabilities. As of September 30, 2015 no cash was required to be held in margin
accounts.

Fair Value Measurements — We report certain assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date (exit price). We primarily use quoted market prices and other observable
market pricing information in valuing our financial assets and liabilities and minimize the use of unobservable
pricing inputs in our measurements.

Fair-value estimates also consider our own creditworthiness and the creditworthiness of the counterparties
involved. Our counterparties consist primarily of financial institutions and major energy companies. This concen-
tration of counterparties may materially impact our exposure to credit risk resulting from market, economic or
regulatory conditions. We seek to minimize counterparty credit risk through an evaluation of their financial con-
dition and credit ratings and the use of collateral requirements under certain circumstances.

Amounts reported at fair value are subject to potentially significant volatility based upon changes in market
prices, including, but not limited to, the valuation of the portfolio of our contracts, maturity and settlement of
these contracts and newly originated transactions and interest rates, each of which directly affect the estimated
fair value of our financial instruments. We believe the market prices and models used to value these financial
instruments represent the best information available with respect to closing exchange and over-the-counter quota-
tions, time value and volatility factors underlying the contracts. Values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact
of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under then current market conditions.

Authoritative accounting literature establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to meas-
ure fair value based on observable and unobservable data. The hierarchy categorizes the inputs into three levels,
with the highest priority given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
(Level 1) and the lowest priority given to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The levels of the hierarchy are described
below:

Level 1 — Represents unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active
market for the asset or liability is defined as a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with
sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Prices actively quoted on
national exchanges are used to determine the fair value of most of our assets and liabilities recorded on our bal-
ance sheet at fair value. Within our nonregulated operations, we utilize a mid-market pricing convention (the

60

ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

mid-point between the bid and ask prices), as permitted under current accounting standards. Values derived from
these sources reflect the market in which transactions involving these financial instruments are executed.

Our Level 1 measurements consist primarily of exchange-traded financial instruments, gas stored under-
ground that has been designated as the hedged item in a fair value hedge and our available-for-sale securities.
The Level 1 measurements for investments in the Atmos Energy Corporation Master Retirement Trust (the Mas-
ter Trust), Supplemental Executive Benefit Plan and postretirement benefit plan consist primarily of exchange-
traded financial instruments.

Level 2 — Represents pricing inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are either directly or
indirectly observable for the asset or liability as of the reporting date. These inputs are derived principally from,
or corroborated by, observable market data. Our Level 2 measurements primarily consist of non-exchange-traded
financial instruments, such as over-the-counter options and swaps and municipal and corporate bonds where
market data for pricing is observable. The Level 2 measurements for investments in our Master Trust, Supple-
mental Executive Benefit Plan and postretirement benefit plan consist primarily of non-exchange traded financial
instruments such as common collective trusts, corporate bonds and investments in limited partnerships.

Level 3 — Represents generally unobservable pricing inputs which are developed based on the best
information available, including our own internal data, in situations where there is little if any market activity for
the asset or liability at the measurement date. The pricing inputs utilized reflect what a market participant would
use to determine fair value. We currently do not have any Level 3 investments.

Pension and other postretirement plans — Pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are
determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market
value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, assumed discount rates and current demo-
graphic and actuarial mortality data. Our measurement date is September 30. The assumed discount rate and the
expected return are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs and
liabilities. The assumed discount rate, the assumed health care cost trend rate and assumed rates of retirement
generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities.

The discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of our pension and post-
retirement obligation and net pension and postretirement cost. When establishing our discount rate, we consider
high quality corporate bond rates based on bonds available in the marketplace that are suitable for settling the
obligations, changes in those rates from the prior year and the implied discount rate that is derived from matching
our projected benefit disbursements with currently available high quality corporate bonds.

The expected long-term rate of return on assets is utilized in calculating the expected return on plan assets
component of the annual pension and postretirement plan cost. We estimate the expected return on plan assets by
evaluating expected bond returns, equity risk premiums, asset allocations, the effects of active plan management,
the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance. We also consider the guidance from our
investment advisors when making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets. To the extent the
actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate, that
year’s annual pension or postretirement plan cost is not affected. Rather, this gain or loss is amortized over the
expected future working lifetime of the plan participants.

The expected return on plan assets is then calculated by applying the expected long-term rate of return on
plan assets to the market-related value of the plan assets. The market-related value of our plan assets represents
the fair market value of the plan assets, adjusted to smooth out short-term market fluctuations over a five-year
period. The use of this calculation will delay the impact of current market fluctuations on the pension expense for
the period.

We use a corridor approach to amortize actuarial gains and losses. Under this approach, net gains or losses
in excess of ten percent of the larger of the pension benefit obligation or the market-related value of the assets are

61

ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

amortized on a straight-line basis. The period of amortization is the average remaining service of active partic-
ipants who are expected to receive benefits under the plan.
We estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in determining our annual postretirement net cost
based upon our actual health care cost experience, the effects of recently enacted legislation and general
economic conditions. Our assumed rate of retirement is estimated based upon the annual review of our partic-
ipant census information as of the measurement date.
Income taxes — Income taxes are determined based on the liability method, which results in income tax
assets and liabilities arising from temporary differences. Temporary differences are differences between the tax
bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements that will result in taxable or
deductible amounts in future years. The liability method requires the effect of tax rate changes on accumulated
deferred income taxes to be reflected in the period in which the rate change was enacted. The liability method
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance unless it is more likely than not that the
assets will be realized.
The Company may recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is at least more likely
than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical
merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be
measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon
settlement with the taxing authorities. We recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as a
component of interest expense. We recognize penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of
miscellaneous income (expense) in accordance with regulatory requirements.
Tax collections — We are allowed to recover from customers revenue-related taxes that are imposed upon
us. We record such taxes as operating expenses and record the corresponding customer charges as operating
revenues. However, we do collect and remit various other taxes on behalf of various governmental authorities,
and we record these amounts in our consolidated balance sheets on a net basis. We do not collect income taxes
from our customers on behalf of governmental authorities.
Contingencies — In the normal course of business, we are confronted with issues or events that may result
in a contingent liability. These generally relate to lawsuits, claims made by third parties or the action of various
regulatory agencies. For such matters, we record liabilities when they are considered probable and reasonably
estimable, based on currently available facts and our estimates of the ultimate outcome or resolution of the
liability in the future. Actual results may differ from estimates, depending on actual outcomes or changes in the
facts or expectations surrounding each potential exposure.
Subsequent events — Except as noted in Note 5 regarding the renewal of our revolving credit facility and
the AEM uncommitted 364-day bilateral credit facility and Note 15 regarding the proposed sale of AEM, no
events occurred subsequent to the balance sheet date that would require recognition or disclosure in the financial
statements.
Recent accounting pronouncements — In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard that will supersede virtually all existing revenue
recognition guidance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Under the new stan-
dard, a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount
that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or serv-
ices. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under current guid-
ance. The new standard is currently scheduled to become effective for us beginning on October 1, 2018 and can
be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of
adoption. As of September 30, 2016, we were actively evaluating all of our sources of revenue to determine the
potential effect of the new standard on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows and the tran-
sition approach we will utilize. We are also actively monitoring the deliberations of the FASB’s Transition
Resource Group as decisions made by this group will impact the final conclusions of this evaluation.

In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs, which requires
that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct
deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. The new guidance aligns the presentation of debt issu-
ance costs with debt discounts and premiums. While the guidance would have been effective for us beginning
October 1, 2016, we elected early adoption effective September 30, 2016 and have applied the provisions of the
new guidance to each prior period presented. As a result, we reclassified $17.0 million and $17.9 million of
unamortized debt issuance costs from deferred charges and other assets to long-term debt on the September 30,
2016 and 2015 consolidated balance sheets.

In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the accounting for fees paid in connection with
arrangements with cloud-based software providers. Under the new guidance, unless a software arrangement
includes specific elements enabling customers to possess and operate software on platforms other than that
offered by the cloud-based provider, the cost of such arrangements is to be accounted for as an operating expense
in the period incurred. The new guidance is effective for us beginning October 1, 2016 and may be applied either
prospectively or retrospectively with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this standard will not impact on
our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In May 2015, the FASB issued guidance removing the requirement to categorize within the fair value hier-
archy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. The
guidance is effective for us on October 1, 2016 to be applied retrospectively. The adoption of this standard will
have no impact on our results of operations, consolidated balance sheets or cash flows.

In November 2015, the FASB issued guidance that requires all deferred income tax liabilities and assets to
be presented as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Previously, entities were required to separate deferred
income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified balance sheet. As permitted
under the new guidance, we elected early adoption as of March 31, 2016. The adoption of this guidance had no
impact on our results of operations or cash flows. Because we adopted this new guidance prospectively, prior
periods have not been adjusted.

In January 2016, the FASB issued guidance related to the classification and measurement of financial
instruments. The amendments modify the accounting and presentation for certain financial liabilities and equity
investments not consolidated or reported using the equity method. The guidance is effective for us beginning
October 1, 2018; limited early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of this new
guidance.

In February 2016, the FASB issued a comprehensive new leasing standard that will require lessees to recog-
nize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than 12
months on its balance sheet. The new standard will be effective for us beginning on October 1, 2019; early adop-
tion is permitted. The new leasing standard requires modified retrospective transition, which requires application
of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the year of adoption. We are
currently evaluating the effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the accounting and reporting of share-based payment
arrangements. Key modifications required under the new guidance include:

‰ Recognition of all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies associated with stock-based compensation as
income tax expense or benefit in the income statement in the period the awards vest. The guidance also
requires these income tax inflows and outflows to be classified as an operating activity.

‰ Simplification of the accounting for forfeitures.

‰ Clarification that cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax-withholding pur-
poses should be classified as a financing activity.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As permitted under the new guidance, we elected early adoption as of March 31, 2016. In accordance with
the transition requirements, we recorded a $14.5 million cumulative-effect increase to retained earnings as of
October 1, 2015, with an offsetting increase to the Company’s net operating loss (NOL) deferred tax asset to
recognize the effect of excess tax benefits earned prior to September 30, 2015. For the year ended September 30,
2016, we have recognized a total income tax benefit of $5.0 million. The new guidance provides for certain
provisions to be accounted for prospectively and others retrospectively.

In June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which will require credit losses on most financial assets meas-
ured at amortized cost and certain other instruments to be measured using an expected credit loss model. Under
this model, entities will estimate credit losses over the entire contractual term of the instrument from the date of
initial recognition of that instrument. In contrast, current U.S. GAAP is based on an incurred loss model that
delays recognition of credit losses until it is probable the loss has been incurred. The new guidance also
introduces a new impairment recognition model for available-for-sale securities that will require credit losses for
available-for-sale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance account. The new standard will be effec-
tive for us beginning on October 1, 2021; early adoption is permitted beginning on October 1, 2019. We are cur-
rently evaluating the potential impact of this new guidance.

3. Segment Information

Atmos Energy Corporation and its subsidiaries are engaged primarily in the regulated natural gas dis-
tribution and pipeline business as well as other nonregulated businesses. We distribute natural gas through sales
and transportation arrangements to over three million residential, commercial, public authority and industrial
customers through our six regulated distribution divisions, which cover service areas located in eight states. In
addition, we transport natural gas for others through our distribution system.

Through our nonregulated business, we provide natural gas management and transportation services to
municipalities, regulated distribution companies, including certain divisions of Atmos Energy and third parties.

We operate the Company through the following three segments:

‰ The regulated distribution segment, includes our regulated distribution and related sales operations.

‰ The regulated pipeline segment, includes the regulated pipeline and storage operations of our Atmos Pipe-
line — Texas Division.

‰ The nonregulated segment, is comprised of our nonregulated natural gas management, nonregulated natu-
ral gas transmission, storage and other services.

Our determination of reportable segments considers the strategic operating units under which we manage
sales of various products and services to customers in differing regulatory environments. Although our regulated
distribution segment operations are geographically dispersed, they are aggregated and reported as a single seg-
ment as each regulated distribution division has similar economic characteristics. The accounting policies of the
segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. We evaluate
performance based on net income or loss of the respective operating units. Interest expense is allocated pro rata
to each segment based upon our net investment in each segment. Income taxes are allocated to each segment as if
each segment’s taxes were calculated on a separate return basis.

4. Earnings Per Share

Since we have non-vested share-based payments with a nonforfeitable right to dividends or dividend equiv-
alents (referred to as participating securities), we are required to use the two-class method of computing earnings
per share. The Company’s non-vested restricted stock units, granted under the 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan,
for which vesting is predicated solely on the passage of time, are considered to be participating securities. The
calculation of earnings per share using the two-class method excludes income attributable to these participating
securities from the numerator and excludes the dilutive impact of those shares from the denominator.

On September 22, 2016, we entered into a three year, $200 million multi-draw term loan agreement with a
syndicate of three lenders. Borrowings under the term loan may be made in increments of $1.0 million or higher,
may be repaid at any time during the loan period and will bear interest at a rate dependent upon our credit ratings
at the time of such borrowing and based, at our election, on a base rate or LIBOR for the applicable interest

period. The term loan will be used to refinance existing indebtedness and for working capital, capital
expenditures and other general corporate purposes. At September 30, 2016, there were no borrowings under the
term loan.
On October 15, 2014, we issued $500 million of 4.125% 30-year unsecured senior notes, which replaced, on
a long-term basis, our $500 million unsecured 4.95% senior notes. The effective rate of these notes is 4.086%,
after giving effect to the offering costs and the settlement of the associated forward starting interest rate swaps
discussed in Note 13. The net proceeds of approximately $494 million were used to repay our $500 million
4.95% senior unsecured notes at maturity on October 15, 2014.

Short-term debt
Our short-term debt is utilized to fund ongoing working capital needs, such as our seasonal requirements for
gas supply and general corporate liquidity. Our short-term borrowings typically reach their highest levels in the
winter months.
As of September 30, 2016, we financed our short-term borrowing requirements through a combination of a
$1.25 billion commercial paper program, four committed revolving credit facilities and one uncommitted revolv-
ing credit facility, with a total availability from third-party lenders of approximately $1.3 billion of working capi-
tal funding. On October 5, 2016, we amended our existing $1.25 billion unsecured credit facility (the five-year
unsecured credit facility) which increased the committed loan to $1.5 billion and extended the facility through
September 25, 2021. The amended facility also retains the $250 million accordion feature, which provides the
opportunity to increase the total committed loan amount to $1.75 billion. After giving effect to the amended
facility, we have total availability from third-party lenders of approximately $1.6 billion of working capital fund-
ing. At September 30, 2016 and 2015, there was $829.8 million and $457.9 million outstanding under our com-
mercial paper program with weighted average interest rates of 0.81% and 0.42%, with average maturities of less
than one month. We also use intercompany credit facilities to supplement the funding provided by these third-
party committed credit facilities. These facilities are described in greater detail below.

Regulated Operations
We fund our regulated operations as needed, primarily through our commercial paper program and three
committed revolving credit facilities with third-party lenders. The first facility is the five-year unsecured credit
facility described above, which bears interest at a base rate or at a LIBOR-based rate for the applicable interest
period, plus a spread ranging from zero percent to 1.25 percent, based on the Company’s credit ratings. This
credit facility serves primarily as a backup liquidity facility for our commercial paper program. At September 30,
2016, there were no borrowings under this facility, but we had $829.8 million of commercial paper outstanding
leaving $420.2 million available.
The second facility is a $25 million unsecured facility that bears interest at a daily negotiated rate, generally
based on the Federal Funds rate plus a variable margin. This facility was renewed on April 1, 2016. At Sep-
tember 30, 2016, there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility.
The third facility, which was renewed on September 30, 2016, is a $10 million committed revolving credit
facility, used primarily to issue letters of credit and bears interest at a LIBOR-based rate plus 1.5 percent. At
September 30, 2016, there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility; however, letters of credit
totaling $5.9 million had been issued under the facility at September 30, 2016, which reduced the amount avail-
able by a corresponding amount.
The availability of funds under these credit facilities is subject to conditions specified in the respective
credit agreements, all of which we currently satisfy. These conditions include our compliance with financial
covenants and the continued accuracy of representations and warranties contained in these agreements. We are
required by the financial covenants in our five-year unsecured facility to maintain, at the end of each fiscal quar-
ter, a ratio of total debt to total capitalization of no greater than 70 percent. At September 30, 2016, our total-
debt-to-total-capitalization ratio, as defined, was 50 percent. In addition, both the interest margin over the

Eurodollar rate and the fee that we pay on unused amounts under each of these facilities are subject to adjustment
depending upon our credit ratings.

In addition to these third-party facilities, our regulated operations have a $500 million intercompany revolv-
ing credit facility with AEH. This facility bears interest at the lower of (i) the Eurodollar rate under the five-year
revolving credit facility or (ii) the lowest rate outstanding under the commercial paper program. Applicable state
regulatory commissions have approved our use of this facility through December 31, 2016. We intend to seek
renewal of this facility during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. There was $197.0 million outstanding under this
facility at September 30, 2016.

Nonregulated Operations

Atmos Energy Marketing, LLC (AEM), which is wholly owned by AEH, has one uncommitted $25 million
364-day bilateral credit facility that expires in December 2016 and one committed $15 million 364-day bilateral
credit facility that was renewed on September 30, 2016. On October 25, 2016, the uncommitted $25 million 364-
day bilateral credit facility was renewed through July 31, 2017. These facilities are used primarily to issue letters
of credit. Due to outstanding letters of credit, the total amount available to us under these bilateral credit facilities
was $32.8 million at September 30, 2016.

AEH has a $500 million intercompany demand credit facility with AEC. This facility bears interest at a rate
equal to the one-month LIBOR rate plus 3.00 percent. Applicable state regulatory commissions have approved
our use of this facility through December 31, 2016. We intend to seek renewal of this facility during the first
quarter of fiscal 2017. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at September 30, 2016.

Debt Covenants

In addition to the financial covenants described above, our credit facilities and public indentures contain
usual and customary covenants for our business, including covenants substantially limiting liens, substantial asset
sales and mergers.

Additionally, our public debt indentures relating to our senior notes and debentures, as well as our revolving
credit agreements, each contain a default provision that is triggered if outstanding indebtedness arising out of any
other credit agreements in amounts ranging from in excess of $15 million to in excess of $100 million becomes
due by acceleration or is not paid at maturity.

We were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of September 30, 2016. If we were unable to
comply with our debt covenants, we would likely be required to repay our outstanding balances on demand, pro-
vide additional collateral or take other corrective actions.

Maturities of long-term debt at September 30, 2016 were as follows (in thousands):

Shareholders’ Equity

Shelf Registration

On March 28, 2016, we filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
that originally permitted us to issue, from time to time, up to $2.5 billion in common stock and/or debt securities,
which replaced our registration statement that expired on March 28, 2016. At September 30, 2016, $2.4 billion of
securities remain available for issuance under the shelf registration statement.

At-the-Market Equity Sales Program

On March 28, 2016, we entered into an at-the-market (ATM) equity distribution agreement (the Agreement)
with Goldman, Sachs & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Morgan Stanley & Co.
LLC in their capacity as agents and/or as principals (Agents). Under the terms of the Agreement, we may issue
and sell, through any of the Agents, shares of our common stock, up to an aggregate offering price of $200 mil-
lion, through the period ended March 28, 2019. We may also sell shares from time to time to an Agent for its
own account at a price to be agreed upon at the time of sale. We will pay each Agent a commission of 1.0% of
the gross offering proceeds of the shares sold through it as a sales agent. We have no obligation to offer or sell
any shares under the Agreement, and may at any time suspend offers and sales under the Agreement. The shares
will be issued pursuant to our shelf registration statement filed with the SEC on March 28, 2016. During fiscal
2016, we sold 1,360,756 shares of common stock under the ATM program for $100.0 million and received net
proceeds of $98.6 million.

1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan

In August 1998, the Board of Directors approved and adopted the 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP),
which became effective in October 1998 after approval by our shareholders. The LTIP is a comprehensive, long-
term incentive compensation plan providing for discretionary awards of incentive stock options, non-qualified
stock options, stock appreciation rights, bonus stock, time-lapse restricted stock, time-lapse restricted stock units,
performance-based restricted stock units and stock units to certain employees and non-employee directors of the
Company and our subsidiaries. The objectives of this plan include attracting and retaining the best personnel,
providing for additional performance incentives and promoting our success by providing employees with the
opportunity to acquire our common stock.

As of September 30, 2015, we were authorized to grant awards for up to a maximum of 8.7 million shares of
common stock under this plan subject to certain adjustment provisions. In February 2016, our shareholders voted
to increase the number of authorized LTIP shares by 2.5 million shares and to extend the term of the plan for an
additional five years, through September 2021. On March 29, 2016, we filed with the SEC a registration state-
ment on Form S-8 to register an additional 2.5 million shares; we also listed such shares with the New York
Stock Exchange. As of September 30, 2016, we were authorized to grant awards for up to a maximum of 11.2
million shares of common stock under this plan subject to certain adjustment provisions.

2014 Equity Offering

On February 18, 2014, we completed the public offering of 9,200,000 shares of our common stock including
the underwriters’ exercise of their overallotment option of 1,200,000 shares under our existing shelf registration
statement. The offering was priced at $44.00 per share and generated net proceeds of $390.2 million, which were
used to repay short-term debt outstanding under our commercial paper program, to fund infrastructure spending
primarily to enhance the safety and reliability of our system and for general corporate purposes.

Share Repurchase Program

On September 28, 2011, the Board of Directors approved a program authorizing the repurchase of up to five
million shares of common stock over a five-year period. The program expired on September 30, 2016 and will
not be renewed. We did not repurchase any shares during fiscal 2016, 2015, or 2014 under the program.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

We record deferred gains (losses) in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) related to available-
for-sale securities, interest rate agreement cash flow hedges and commodity contract cash flow hedges. Deferred
gains (losses) for our available-for-sale securities and commodity contract cash flow hedges are recognized in
earnings upon settlement, while deferred gains (losses) related to our interest rate agreement cash flow hedges
are recognized in earnings as they are amortized. The following tables provide the components of our accumu-
lated other comprehensive income (loss) balances, net of the related tax effects allocated to each component of
other comprehensive income.

7. Retirement and Post-Retirement Employee Benefit Plans

We have both funded and unfunded noncontributory defined benefit plans that together cover most of our
employees. We also maintain post-retirement plans that provide health care benefits to retired employees.
Finally, we sponsor a defined contribution plan that cover substantially all employees. These plans are discussed
in further detail below.

As a rate regulated entity, we generally recover our pension costs in our rates over a period of up to
15 years. The amounts that have not yet been recognized in net periodic pension cost that have been recorded as
regulatory assets are as follows:

Defined Benefit Plans

Employee Pension Plan

Prior to December 31, 2014, we maintained two defined benefit plans: the Atmos Energy Corporation Pen-
sion Account Plan (the Plan) and the Atmos Energy Corporation Retirement Plan for Mississippi Valley Gas
Union Employees (the Union Plan) (collectively referred to as the Plans). The assets of the Plans were held
within the Atmos Energy Corporation Master Retirement Trust (the Master Trust). In June 2014, active collec-
tively bargained employees of Atmos Energy’s Mississippi Division voted to decertify the union. As a result of
this vote, effective January 1, 2015, active participants of the Union Plan became participants in the Plan. Open-
ing account balances were established at the time of transfer equal to the present value of their respective accrued
benefits under the Union Plan at December 31, 2014. Additionally, effective January 1, 2015, current retirees in
the Union Plan as well as those participants who terminated and were vested in the Union Plan were transferred
to the Plan with the same provisions that were in place at the time of their retirement or termination.

The Plan is a cash balance pension plan that was established effective January 1999 and covers most of the
employees of Atmos Energy’s regulated operations that were hired before September 30, 2010. The plan was
closed to new participants effective October 1, 2010.

Opening account balances were established for participants as of January 1999 equal to the present value of
their respective accrued benefits under the pension plans which were previously in effect as of December 31,
1998. The Plan credits an allocation to each participant’s account at the end of each year according to a formula
based on the participant’s age, service and total pay (excluding incentive pay). In addition, at the end of each
year, a participant’s account is credited with interest on the employee’s prior year account balance. Participants
are fully vested in their account balances after three years of service and may choose to receive their account
balances as a lump sum or an annuity.

Generally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount in accordance with the requirements of
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, including the funding requirements under the Pension
Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). However, additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as
considered necessary. Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but
also for those expected to be earned in the future.

During fiscal 2016 and 2015 we contributed $15.0 million and $38.0 million in cash to the Plan to achieve a
desired level of funding while maximizing the tax deductibility of this payment. Based upon market conditions at
September 30, 2016, the current funded position of the Plan and the funding requirements under the PPA, we do
not anticipate a minimum required contribution for fiscal 2017. However, we may consider whether a voluntary
contribution is prudent to maintain certain funding levels.

We make investment decisions and evaluate performance of the assets in the Master Trust on a medium-
term horizon of at least three to five years. We also consider our current financial status when making recom-
mendations and decisions regarding the Master Trust’s assets. Finally, we strive to ensure the Master Trust’s
assets are appropriately invested to maintain an acceptable level of risk and meet the Master Trust’s long-term
asset investment policy adopted by the Board of Directors.

To achieve these objectives, we invest the Master Trust’s assets in equity securities, fixed income securities,
interests in commingled pension trust funds, other investment assets and cash and cash equivalents. Investments
in equity securities are diversified among the market’s various subsectors in an effort to diversify risk and max-
imize returns. Fixed income securities are invested in investment grade securities. Cash equivalents are invested
in securities that either are short term (less than 180 days) or readily convertible to cash with modest risk.

2015.

At September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Plan held 956,700 and 1,169,700 shares of our common stock which
represented 15.1 percent and 15.2 percent of total Plan assets. These shares generated dividend income for the
Plan of approximately $1.8 million during fiscal 2016 and 2015.

Our employee pension plan expenses and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by
numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return
on plan assets and assumed discount rates and demographic data. We review the estimates and assumptions
underlying our employee pension plans annually based upon a September 30 measurement date. The develop-
ment of our assumptions is fully described in our significant accounting policies in Note 2. The actuarial assump-
tions used to determine the pension liability for the Plan was determined as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 and
the actuarial assumptions used to determine the net periodic pension cost for the Plan was determined as of Sep-
tember 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013. On October 20, 2016, the Society of Actuaries released its annually-updated
mortality improvement scale for pension plans incorporating new assumptions surrounding life expectancies in
the United States. As of September 30, 2016, we updated our assumed mortality rates to incorporate the updated
mortality table.

entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The methods used to
determine fair value for the assets held by the Plan are fully described in Note 2. In addition to the assets shown
below, the Plan had net accounts receivable of $2.6 million and $2.4 million at September 30, 2016 and 2015

Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans

We have three nonqualified supplemental plans which provide additional pension, disability and death bene-
fits to our officers, division presidents and certain other employees of the Company.

The first plan is referred to as the Supplemental Executive Benefits Plan (SEBP) and covers our officers,
division presidents and certain other employees of the Company who were employed on or before August 12,
1998. The SEBP is a defined benefit arrangement which provides a benefit equal to 75 percent of covered com-
pensation under which benefits paid from the underlying qualified defined benefit plan are an offset to the bene-
fits under the SEBP.

In August 1998, we adopted the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) (formerly known as the
Performance-Based Supplemental Executive Benefits Plan), which covers all officers or division presidents
selected to participate in the plan between August 12, 1998 and August 5, 2009, any corporate officer who may
be appointed to the Management Committee after August 5, 2009 and any other employees selected by our Board
of Directors at its discretion. The SERP is a defined benefit arrangement which provides a benefit equal to 60
percent of covered compensation under which benefits paid from the underlying qualified defined benefit plan
are an offset to the benefits under the SERP.

Effective August 5, 2009, we adopted a new defined benefit Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the
2009 SERP), for corporate officers (other than such officer who is appointed as a member of the Company’s
Management Committee), division presidents or any other employees selected at the discretion of the Board.
Under the 2009 SERP, a nominal account has been established for each participant, to which the Company con-
tributes at the end of each calendar year an amount equal to ten percent of the total of each participant’s base
salary and cash incentive compensation earned during each prior calendar year, beginning December 31, 2009.
The benefits vest after three years of service and attainment of age 55 and earn interest credits at the same annual
rate as the Company’s Pension Account Plan (currently 4.69%).

On October 2, 2013, due to the retirement of one of our executives, we recognized a settlement loss of $4.5
million associated with our SEBP and made a $16.8 million benefit payment.

Postretirement Benefits

We sponsor the Retiree Medical Plan for Retirees and Disabled Employees of Atmos Energy Corporation
(the Atmos Retiree Medical Plan). This plan provides medical and prescription drug protection to all qualified
participants based on their date of retirement. The Atmos Retiree Medical Plan provides different levels of bene-
fits depending on the level of coverage chosen by the participants and the terms of predecessor plans; however,
we generally pay 80 percent of the projected net claims and administrative costs and participants pay the remain-
ing 20 percent of this cost. Effective January 1, 2015 for employees who had not met the participation require-
ments by September 30, 2009, the contribution rates for the Company will be limited to a three percent cost
increase in claims and administrative costs each year, with the participant responsible for the additional costs.

Generally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount in accordance with the requirements of
ERISA. However, additional voluntary contributions are made annually as considered necessary. Contributions
are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned
in the future. We expect to contribute between $10 million and $20 million to our postretirement benefits plan
during fiscal 2017.

We maintain a formal investment policy with respect to the assets in our postretirement benefits plan to
ensure the assets funding the postretirement benefit plan are appropriately invested to maintain an acceptable
level of risk. We also consider our current financial status when making recommendations and decisions regard-
ing the postretirement benefits plan.

techniques as our employee pension plans. The actuarial assumptions used to determine the pension liability for
our postretirement plan were determined as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 and the actuarial assumptions used
to determine the net periodic pension cost for the postretirement plan were determined as of September 30, 2015,

We are currently recovering other postretirement benefits costs through our regulated rates under accrual
accounting as prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States in substantially all of
our service areas. Other postretirement benefits costs have been specifically addressed in rate orders in each
jurisdiction served by our Kentucky/Mid-States, West Texas, Mid-Tex and Mississippi Divisions as well as our
Kansas jurisdiction and Atmos Pipeline — Texas or have been included in a rate case and not disallowed. Man-
agement believes that this accounting method is appropriate and will continue to seek rate recovery of accrual-
based expenses in its ratemaking jurisdictions that have not yet approved the recovery of these expenses.

The following tables set forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the Retiree Medical Plan’s assets at

The Atmos Energy Corporation Retirement Savings Plan and Trust (the Retirement Savings Plan) covers
substantially all employees and is subject to the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.
Effective January 1, 2007, employees automatically become participants of the Retirement Savings Plan on the
date of employment. Participants may elect a salary reduction up to a maximum of 65 percent of eligible
compensation, as defined by the Plan, not to exceed the maximum allowed by the Internal Revenue Service. New
participants are automatically enrolled in the Plan at a salary reduction amount of four percent of eligible
compensation, from which they may opt out. We match 100 percent of a participant’s contributions, limited to
four percent of the participant’s salary, in our common stock. However, participants have the option to immedi-
ately transfer this matching contribution into other funds held within the plan. Participants are eligible to receive
matching contributions after completing one year of service. Participants are also permitted to take out loans
against their accounts subject to certain restrictions. Employees hired on or after October 1, 2010 participate in
the enhanced plan in which participants receive a fixed annual contribution of four percent of eligible earnings to
their Retirement Savings Plan account. Participants will continue to be eligible for company matching con-
tributions of up to four percent of their eligible earnings and will be fully vested in the fixed annual contribution
after three years of service.

Prior to December 31, 2015, we also maintained the Atmos Energy Holdings, LLC 401(k) Profit-Sharing
Plan (the AEH 401(k) Profit-Sharing Plan), which covered substantially all AEH employees. On November 4,
2015, the Atmos Energy Corporation Board of Directors voted to approve the merger of the assets and liabilities
of the AEH 401(k) Profit-Sharing Plan with the Retirement Savings Plan, effective January 1, 2016. On
December 31, 2015, the AEH 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan was merged into the Retirement Savings Plan and all
assets and loans of active and inactive participants were transferred to the Retirement Savings Plan.

Prior to December 31, 2014, we maintained the Atmos Energy Corporation Savings Plan for MVG Union
Employees (the Union 401(k) Plan). In June 2014, active collectively bargained employees of Atmos Energy’s
Mississippi Division voted to decertify the Union. As a result, effective July 19, 2014, active participants of the
Union 401(k) Plan were eligible to participate in the Retirement Savings Plan. Effective January 1, 2015, all
remaining participants became participants in the Retirement Savings Plan and the Union 401(k) Plan was termi-
nated.

Matching contributions to the Retirement Savings Plan (and prior to December 31, 2014, the Union 401(k)
Plan) are expensed as incurred and amounted to $12.6 million, $11.5 million and $10.9 million for fiscal years
2016, 2015 and 2014. The Board of Directors may also approve discretionary contributions, subject to the provi-
sions of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable Treasury regulations. No discretionary contributions were

made for fiscal years 2016, 2015 or 2014. At September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Retirement Savings Plan held 4.2
percent and 4.3 percent of our outstanding common stock. Discretionary contributions to the AEH 401(k) Profit-
Sharing Plan were expensed as incurred and amounted to $0.3 million, $1.1 million and $1.4 million for fiscal
years 2016, 2015 and 2014.

8. Stock and Other Compensation Plans

Stock-Based Compensation Plans

Total stock-based compensation cost was $24.6 million, $27.5 million and $25.5 million for the fiscal years
ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Of this amount, $9.8 million, $11.5 million and $10.8 million was
capitalized. Tax benefits related to stock-based compensation were $5.0 million, $4.7 million and $3.1 million
for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan

In August 1998, the Board of Directors approved and adopted the 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP),
which became effective in October 1998 after approval by our shareholders. The LTIP is a comprehensive, long-
term incentive compensation plan providing for discretionary awards of incentive stock options, non-qualified
stock options, stock appreciation rights, bonus stock, time-lapse restricted stock, time-lapse restricted stock units,
performance-based restricted stock units and stock units to certain employees and non-employee directors of the
Company and our subsidiaries. The objectives of this plan include attracting and retaining the best personnel,
providing for additional performance incentives and promoting our success by providing employees with the
opportunity to acquire common stock.

As of September 30, 2016, we were authorized to grant awards for up to a maximum of 11.2 million shares
of common stock under this plan subject to certain adjustment provisions. As of September 30, 2016, non-
qualified stock options, bonus stock, time-lapse restricted stock, time-lapse restricted stock units, performance-
based restricted stock units and stock units had been issued under this plan, and 2.4 million shares were available
for future issuance.

Restricted Stock Unit Award Grants

As noted above, the LTIP provides for discretionary awards of restricted stock units to help attract, retain
and reward employees of Atmos Energy and its subsidiaries. Certain of these awards vest based upon the passage
of time and other awards vest based upon the passage of time and the achievement of specified performance tar-
gets. The fair value of the awards granted is based on the market price of our stock at the date of grant. We esti-
mate forfeitures using our historical forfeiture rate. The associated expense is recognized ratably over the vesting
period. We use authorized and unissued shares to meet share requirements for the vesting of restricted stock
units.

Employees who are granted time-lapse restricted stock units under our LTIP have a nonforfeitable right to
dividend equivalents that are paid at the same rate and at the same time at which they are paid on shares of stock
without restrictions. Time-lapse restricted stock units contain only a service condition that the employee recipi-
ents render continuous services to the Company for a period of three years from the date of grant, except for
accelerated vesting in the event of death, disability, change of control of the Company or termination without
cause (with certain exceptions). There are no performance conditions required to be met for employees to be
vested in time-lapse restricted stock units.

Employees who are granted performance-based restricted stock units under our LTIP have a forfeitable right
to dividend equivalents that accrue at the same rate at which they are paid on shares of stock without restrictions.
Dividend equivalents on the performance-based restricted stock units are paid either in cash or in the form of
shares upon the vesting of the award. Performance-based restricted stock units contain a service condition that
the employee recipients render continuous services to the Company for a period of three years from the begin-

ning of the applicable three-year performance period, except for accelerated vesting in the event of death, dis-
ability, change of control of the Company or termination without cause (with certain exceptions) and a perform-
ance condition based on a cumulative earnings per share target amount.

As of September 30, 2016, there was $11.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-
vested time-lapse restricted stock units granted under the LTIP. That cost is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of 1.6 years. The fair value of restricted stock vested during the fiscal years ended Sep-
tember 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $20.6 million, $21.7 million and $17.1 million.

Other Plans

Direct Stock Purchase Plan

We maintain a Direct Stock Purchase Plan, open to all investors, which allows participants to have all or
part of their cash dividends paid quarterly in additional shares of our common stock. The minimum initial
investment required to join the plan is $1,250. Direct Stock Purchase Plan participants may purchase additional
shares of our common stock as often as weekly with voluntary cash payments of at least $25, up to an annual
maximum of $100,000.

Outside Directors Stock-For-Fee Plan

In November 1994, the Board of Directors adopted the Outside Directors Stock-for-Fee Plan, which was
approved by our shareholders in February 1995. The plan permits non-employee directors to receive all or part of
their annual retainer and meeting fees in stock rather than in cash. This plan was terminated by the Board of
Directors, effective September 1, 2014, when the LTIP was amended to incorporate substantially all of its provi-
sions.

Equity Incentive and Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors

In November 1998, the Board of Directors adopted the Equity Incentive and Deferred Compensation Plan
for Non-Employee Directors, which was approved by our shareholders in February 1999. This plan amended the
Atmos Energy Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan for Outside Directors adopted by the Company in May
1990 and replaced the pension payable under our Retirement Plan for Non-Employee Directors. The plan pro-
vides non-employee directors of Atmos Energy with the opportunity to defer receipt, until retirement, of
compensation for services rendered to the Company and invest deferred compensation into either a cash account
or a stock account.

Other Discretionary Compensation Plans

We have an annual incentive program covering substantially all employees to give each employee an oppor-
tunity to share in our financial success based on the achievement of key performance measures considered crit-
ical to achieving business objectives for a given year with minimum and maximum thresholds. The Company
must meet the minimum threshold for the plan to be funded and distributed to employees. These performance
measures may include earnings growth objectives, improved cash flow objectives or crucial customer satisfaction
and safety results. We monitor progress towards the achievement of the performance measures throughout the
year and record accruals based upon the expected payout using the best estimates available at the time the accrual
is recorded. During the last several fiscal years, we have used earnings per share as our sole performance meas-
ure.

11. Commitments and Contingencies

Litigation

We are a party to various litigation that has arisen in the ordinary course of our business. While the results
of such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the final outcome of such litigation will not have
a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Environmental Matters

We are a party to environmental matters and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of our business.
While the ultimate results of response actions to these environmental matters and claims cannot be predicted with
certainty, we believe the final outcome of such response actions will not have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows because we believe that the expenditures related to such
response actions will either be recovered through rates, shared with other parties or are adequately covered by
insurance.

Purchase Commitments

Our regulated distribution divisions maintain supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a
period of up to one year. Commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a
monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices. Commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as
necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of the individual contract.

Our Mid-Tex Division also maintains a limited number of long-term supply contracts to ensure a reliable
source of gas for our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at prices
indexed to natural gas trading hubs. At September 30, 2016, we were committed to purchase 28.5 Bcf within one
year, 4.2 Bcf within two to three years and 0.6 Bcf beyond three years under indexed contracts. Purchases under
these contracts totaled $85.3 million, $113.3 million and $140.9 million for 2016, 2015, 2014.

Our nonregulated segment has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural gas under contracts
indexed to the forward NYMEX strip or fixed price contracts. At September 30, 2016, we were committed to
purchase 93.5 Bcf within one year, 9.1 Bcf within two to three years and 0.2 Bcf after three years under indexed
contracts. We are committed to purchase 11.9 Bcf within one year and 1.3 Bcf within one to three years under
fixed price contracts with prices ranging from $0.25 to $3.16 per Mcf. Purchases under these contracts totaled
$763.2 million , $1,141.3 million and $1,687.5 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014.

In addition, our nonregulated segment maintains long-term contracts related to storage and transportation.

At September 30, 2016, we had $494.0 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards. The federal net
operating loss carryforwards are available to offset taxable income and will begin to expire in 2029. The Com-
pany also has $10.1 million of federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards which do not expire. In addi-
tion, the Company has $11.0 million in charitable contribution carryforwards to offset taxable income. The
Company’s charitable contribution carryforwards expire in 2017 - 2021.

For state taxable income, the Company has $20.4 million of state net operating loss carryforwards (net of
$11.0 million of federal effects) and $1.1 million of state tax credits carryforwards (net of federal effects).
Depending on the jurisdiction in which the state net operating loss was generated, the carryforwards will begin to
expire between 2017 and 2031.

We believe it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain charitable contribution carryforwards,
state net operating loss carryforwards and state credit carryforwards will not be realized. Due to the uncertainty

of realizing a benefit from the deferred tax asset recorded for the carryforwards, a valuation allowance of $1.1
million and $5.0 million was established for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. In addition, $1.4
million of deferred tax assets expired for which a valuation allowance had previously been recorded and $0.2
million of deferred tax assets expired for which a valuation allowance had not been previously recorded during
the year ended September 30, 2016.

The Company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penal-
ties in operating expense. During the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized
approximately $2.5 million and $0.5 million in interest and penalties. The Company had approximately $3.3
million and $0.8 million for the payment of interest and penalties accrued at September 30, 2016 and 2015.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction as well as in various states where we have oper-
ations. We have concluded substantially all U.S. federal income tax matters through fiscal year 2007 and con-
cluded substantially all Texas income tax matters through fiscal year 2010.

13. Financial Instruments

We use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk and interest rate risk. The objectives and strat-
egies for using financial instruments have been tailored to our regulated and nonregulated businesses. Currently,
we utilize financial instruments in our regulated distribution and nonregulated segments. We currently do not
manage commodity price risk with financial instruments in our regulated pipeline segment.

Our financial instruments do not contain any credit-risk-related or other contingent features that could cause
accelerated payments when our financial instruments are in net liability positions.

As discussed in Note 2, we report our financial instruments as risk management assets and liabilities, each
of which is classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying finan-
cial instrument. The following table shows the fair values of our risk management assets and liabilities by seg-
ment at September 30, 2016 and 2015:

Regulated Commodity Risk Management Activities

Although our purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms essentially insulate our regulated distribution
segment from commodity price risk, our customers are exposed to the effects of volatile natural gas prices. We
manage this exposure through a combination of physical storage, fixed-price forward contracts and financial
instruments, primarily over-the-counter swap and option contracts, in an effort to minimize the impact of natural
gas price volatility on our customers during the winter heating season.

Our regulated distribution gas supply department is responsible for executing this segment’s commodity risk
management activities in conformity with regulatory requirements. In jurisdictions where we are permitted to
mitigate commodity price risk through financial instruments, the relevant regulatory authorities may establish the
level of heating season gas purchases that can be hedged. Historically, if the regulatory authority does not estab-
lish this level, we seek to hedge between 25 and 50 percent of anticipated heating season gas purchases using
financial instruments. For the 2015-2016 heating season (generally October through March), in the jurisdictions
where we are permitted to utilize financial instruments, we hedged approximately 33 percent, or approximately
23.0 Bcf of the winter flowing gas requirements at a weighted average cost of approximately $3.14 per Mcf. We
have not designated these financial instruments as hedges.

Nonregulated Commodity Risk Management Activities

In our nonregulated operations, we buy, sell and deliver natural gas at competitive prices by aggregating and
purchasing gas supply, arranging transportation and storage logistics and effectively managing commodity price
risk.

As a result of these activities, our nonregulated segment is exposed to risks associated with changes in the
market price of natural gas. We manage our exposure to such risks through a combination of physical storage and
financial instruments, including futures, over-the-counter and exchange-traded options and swap contracts with
counterparties. Future contracts provide the right to buy or sell the commodity at a fixed price in the future.
Option contracts provide the right, but not the requirement, to buy or sell the commodity at a fixed price. Swap
contracts require receipt of payment for the commodity based on the difference between a fixed price and the
market price on the settlement date. Specifically, these operations use financial instruments in the following
ways:

‰ Gas delivery and related services — We use financial instruments, designated as cash flow hedges of
anticipated purchases and sales at index prices, to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with
deliveries under fixed-priced forward contracts to either deliver gas to customers or purchase gas from
suppliers. These financial instruments have maturity dates ranging from one to 63 months.

‰ Transportation and storage services — Our nonregulated operations use storage and basis swaps, futures
and various over-the-counter and exchange-traded options to capture additional storage arbitrage oppor-
tunities that arise subsequent to the execution of the original fair value hedge associated with our physical
natural gas inventory, basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic value of our fixed price and stor-
age books and various over-the-counter and exchange-traded options. These financial instruments have
not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes.

‰ Aggregating and purchasing gas supply — Certain financial instruments, designated as fair value hedges,
are used to hedge our natural gas inventory used in asset optimization activities.

Our nonregulated risk management activities are controlled through various risk management policies and
procedures. Our Audit Committee has oversight responsibility for our nonregulated risk management limits and
policies. A risk committee, comprised of corporate and business unit officers, is responsible for establishing and
enforcing our nonregulated risk management policies and procedures.

Under our risk management policies, we seek to match our financial instrument positions to our physical
storage positions as well as our expected current and future sales and purchase obligations in order to maintain no
open positions at the end of each trading day. The determination of our net open position as of any day, however,
requires us to make assumptions as to future circumstances, including the use of gas by our customers in relation
to our anticipated storage and market positions. Because the price risk associated with any net open position at
the end of each day may increase if the assumptions are not realized, we review these assumptions as part of our
daily monitoring activities. Our operations can also be affected by intraday fluctuations of gas prices, since the
price of natural gas purchased or sold for future delivery earlier in the day may not be hedged until later in the
day. At times, limited net open positions related to our existing and anticipated commitments may occur. At the
close of business on September 30, 2016, our nonregulated segment had net open positions (including existing
storage and related financial contracts) of 0.1 Bcf.

Interest Rate Risk Management Activities

We currently manage interest rate risk through the use of forward starting interest rate swaps to fix the Treas-
ury yield component of the interest cost associated with anticipated financings.

In October 2012, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps to fix the Treasury yield component
associated with the then anticipated issuance of $500 million senior notes in October 2014. These notes were

96

ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

issued as planned in October 2014 and we settled swaps with the receipt of $13.4 million. Because the swaps
were effective, the realized gain was recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and
is being recognized as a component of interest expense over the 30-year life of the senior notes. In October 2012,
we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps to fix the Treasury yield component associated with $210
million of the anticipated issuance of $250 million unsecured senior notes in fiscal 2017. Additionally, in fiscal
2014 and 2015, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps to effectively fix the Treasury yield compo-
nent associated with $450 million of the anticipated issuance of $450 million unsecured senior notes in fiscal
2019. We designated all of these swaps as cash flow hedges at the time the agreements were executed. Accord-
ingly, unrealized gains and losses associated with the forward starting interest rate swaps will be recorded as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). When the forward starting interest rate swaps
settle, the realized gain or loss will be recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) and recognized as a component of interest expense over the life of the related financing arrangement.
Hedge ineffectiveness to the extent incurred, will be reported as a component of interest expense.

Prior to fiscal 2012, we entered into several interest rate agreements to fix the Treasury yield component of
the interest cost of financing for various issuances of long-term debt and senior notes. The gains and losses real-
ized upon settlement of these interest rate agreements were recorded as a component of accumulated other com-
prehensive income (loss) when they were settled and are being recognized as a component of interest expense
over the life of the associated notes from the date of settlement. The remaining amortization periods for the set-
tled interest rate agreements extend through fiscal 2045.

Impact of Financial Instruments on the Income Statement

Hedge ineffectiveness for our nonregulated segment is recorded as a component of purchased gas cost and
primarily results from differences in the location and timing of the derivative instrument and the hedged item.
Hedge ineffectiveness could materially affect our results of operations for the reported period. For the years
ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recognized a gain arising from fair value and cash flow hedge
ineffectiveness of $21.6 million, $0.2 million and $1.9 million. Additional information regarding ineffectiveness
recognized in the income statement is included in the tables below.

$ (919)

Basis ineffectiveness arises from natural gas market price differences between the locations of the hedged
inventory and the delivery location specified in the hedge instruments. Timing ineffectiveness arises due to
changes in the difference between the spot price and the futures price, as well as the difference between the tim-
ing of the settlement of the futures and the valuation of the underlying physical commodity. As the commodity
contract nears the settlement date, spot-to-forward price differences should converge, which should reduce or
eliminate the impact of this ineffectiveness on purchased gas cost.

To the extent that the Company’s natural gas inventory does not qualify as a hedged item in a fair-value
hedge, or has not been designated as such, the natural gas inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market.

Financial Instruments Not Designated as Hedges

The impact of financial instruments that have not been designated as hedges on our consolidated income
statements for the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was an increase (decrease) in purchased gas
cost of $(15.5) million, $15.5 million and $(5.0) million. Note that this presentation does not reflect the expected
gains or losses arising from the underlying physical transactions associated with these financial instruments.
Therefore, this presentation is not indicative of the economic gross profit we realized when the underlying phys-
ical and financial transactions were settled.

As discussed above, financial instruments used in our regulated distribution segment are not designated as
hedges. However, there is no earnings impact on our regulated distribution segment as a result of the use of these
financial instruments because the gains and losses arising from the use of these financial instruments are recog-
nized in the consolidated statement of income as a component of purchased gas cost when the related costs are
recovered through our rates and recognized in revenue. Accordingly, the impact of these financial instruments is
excluded from this presentation.

14. Fair Value Measurements

We report certain assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the price that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measure-
ment date (exit price). We record cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable at carry-
ing value, which substantially approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities.
For other financial assets and liabilities, we primarily use quoted market prices and other observable market pric-
ing information to minimize the use of unobservable pricing inputs in our measurements when determining fair
value. The methods used to determine fair value for our assets and liabilities are fully described in Note 2.

Fair value measurements also apply to the valuation of our pension and post-retirement plan assets. The fair
value of these assets is presented in Note 7.

The classification of our fair value measurements requires judgment regarding the degree to which market
data are observable or corroborated by observable market data. The following tables summarize, by level within
the fair value hierarchy, our assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of
September 30, 2016 and 2015. As required under authoritative accounting literature, assets and liabilities are
categorized in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

(1) Our Level 2 measurements consist of over-the-counter options and swaps, which are valued using a market-
based approach in which observable market prices are adjusted for criteria specific to each instrument, such
as the strike price, notional amount or basis differences, municipal and corporate bonds, which are valued
based on the most recent available quoted market prices and money market funds which are valued at cost.
(2) This column reflects adjustments to our gross financial instrument assets and liabilities to reflect netting
permitted under our master netting agreements and the relevant authoritative accounting literature. In addi-
tion, as of September 30, 2016, we had $25.7 million of cash held in margin accounts to collateralize certain
regulated distribution financial instruments, which were used to offset current and noncurrent risk manage-
ment liabilities. As of September 30, 2016 we also had $24.7 million of cash held in margin accounts to col-
lateralize certain nonregulated financial instruments. Of this amount, $17.9 million was used to offset current
and noncurrent risk management liabilities under master netting agreements and the remaining $6.8 million
is classified as current risk management assets.
(3) This column reflects adjustments to our gross financial instrument assets and liabilities to reflect netting

nonregulated financial instruments. Of this amount, $34.6 million was used to offset current and noncurrent
risk management liabilities under master netting agreements and the remaining $8.9 million is classified as
current risk management assets.

At September 30, 2016 and 2015, our available-for-sale securities included $41.3 million and $41.7 million
related to assets held in separate rabbi trusts for our supplemental executive retirement plans as discussed in Note
7. At September 30, 2016 we maintained investments in bonds that have contractual maturity dates ranging from
October 2016 through May 2020.

Other Fair Value Measures

In addition to the financial instruments above, we have several financial and nonfinancial assets and
liabilities subject to fair value measures. These financial assets and liabilities include cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, accounts payable and debt. The nonfinancial assets and liabilities include asset retirement
obligations and pension and post-retirement plan assets. We record cash and cash equivalents, accounts receiv-
able, accounts payable and debt at carrying value. For cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and
accounts payable, we consider carrying value to materially approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of
these assets and liabilities.

Our debt is recorded at carrying value. The fair value of our debt is determined using third party market
value quotations, which are considered Level 1 fair value measurements for debt instruments with a recent,
observable trade or Level 2 fair value measurements for debt instruments where fair value is determined using
the most recent available quoted market price. The following table presents the carrying value and fair value of
our debt as of September 30, 2016:

CenterPoint Energy Services, Inc., a subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy, Inc. to sell all of the equity interests of
AEM for $40.0 million plus working capital at the date of closing. No material gain or loss is currently antici-
pated in connection with the closing of this transaction. We expect this transaction to close during the second
quarter of fiscal 2017.

16. Concentration of Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to us if a customer fails to perform its contractual obligations. We
engage in transactions for the purchase and sale of products and services with major companies in the energy
industry and with industrial, commercial, residential and municipal energy consumers. These transactions princi-
pally occur in the southern and midwestern regions of the United States. We believe that this geographic concen-
tration does not contribute significantly to our overall exposure to credit risk. Credit risk associated with trade
accounts receivable for the regulated distribution segment is mitigated by the large number of individual custom-
ers and diversity in our customer base. The credit risk for our other segments is not significant.

ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures.

Management’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal
financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
September 30, 2016 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us, including
our consolidated entities, in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC’s rules and forms, including a reasonable
level of assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f), in providing reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accord-
ance with generally accepted accounting principles. Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we evaluated the effective-
ness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 frame-
work) (COSO). Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued
by COSO and applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rules, our management concluded that our
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2016, in providing reasonable assur-
ance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external pur-
poses in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Ernst & Young LLP has issued its report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over finan-
cial reporting. That report appears below.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Atmos Energy Corporation

We have audited Atmos Energy Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30,
2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Atmos Energy
Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and
for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based
on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the compa-
ny’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect mis-
statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that con-
trols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Atmos Energy Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended September 30, 2016 of Atmos Energy Corporation and our report dated November 14, 2016
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We did not make any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Act) during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
