Atmos Energy Corporation 
2015 Summary Annual Report

Safety: Our Core Value

For Atmos Energy, safety is far more than a program, department 
or investment. It is a value that we ascribe to and observe in all 
we do. It is all-inclusive in our strategy and inherent in our culture. 

Cover Travis Cooper (left), an operations manager, and Quint 
Nance, a senior field construction coordinator, both in the Mid-Tex 
Division, inspect construction in East Texas on Atmos Energy ’s largest 
current capital project.

The multi-year job will install about 62 miles of 30-inch coated steel 
pipe in two segments on Atmos Pipeline –Texas’ transmission system. 
When completed in fiscal 2016, the new pipeline will transport natural 
gas from our storage fields to help meet rising demands in the 
Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex from Mid-Tex customers and from other 
local distribution companies.

The project also will substantially improve service reliability. Although 
hampered by heavy rains, the pipeline project remains on schedule— 
a tribute to the engineering and project management expertise of the 
teams responsible for our infrastructure program.

 
 
Atmos Energy continues to modernize its pipeline infrastructure to 
make it even safer and more reliable. During the past five years, 
we have invested approximately $4.0 billion to fortify, replace or 
expand our system. We plan to increase our spending on pipeline 
modernization by more than 50 percent through fiscal 2020.

Atmos Energy’s natural gas transmission and distribution 
pipelines span almost 76,000 miles and range in size from 
2 inches to 36 inches in diameter. We also have some 3.1 
million service lines that carry gas from our mains to our 
customers’ premises. 
 Our pipelines, which were installed over many decades,
are made of various materials. The most common types are
coated steel and polyethylene plastic. However, we also have
pipelines made of cast iron, bare steel and vintage plastic.
 Our modernization program along with federal and state 
compliance rules and regulations determine the pipeline 
assets selected for repair or replacement every year.

We expect that our annual replacements will go up another 
25 percent to 30 percent during the next five years.

Modernizing 
and Improving 
Our Pipeline 
Infrastructure

A major replacement project in our West Texas Division near 
Amarillo involves constructing a new 16-inch coated steel pipeline to retire 
an aging bare steel line installed in the 1930s. Engineer Matt McDonald (left) 
and Dustin Crosley, Amarillo operations supervisor, test the wall thickness of 
the existing pipe before it is tied in with the new line.

In Marrero, Louisiana, the main natural gas artery serving our
customers on the west bank of the Mississippi River in the Greater New
Orleans Region is being replaced by our Louisiana Division. The pipeline,
installed some 70 to 80 years ago, is one of our many modernization
projects across the state. The division expects to replace over many years
a significant portion of its distribution mains as well as aging meters, risers, 
regulator stations and town border stations. Below: A collection of sensitive 
instruments, called a “smart pig,” is sent through a pipeline to detect cracks, 
corrosion, dents or deterioration that might cause a failure. We regularly 
inspect our pipelines as part of our pipeline integrity management programs.

Training Our 
Employees

 To assist in assessing a pipeline’s condition, we use field instrumenta-
tion and engineering analysis to identify anomalies, cracks, deterioration 
or corrosion that might occur. We also conduct hydrostatic testing when 
needed to ensure that a pipeline can operate in excess of its normal oper-
ating pressure and during peak-service periods.
 The obvious benefit of our modernization program is safer and more 
reliable service for our customers and the communities we serve. For tu-
nately, we have received approvals for very balanced regulatory mechanisms 
to suppor t the necessary investments to make these improvements.
 Fur thermore, our customers’ bills have remained relatively flat despite
our modernization expenditures. The abundance and low cost of natural
gas in the United States today is keeping our average residential bills very
af fordable—a situation that we anticipate will remain for years to come.

Our natural gas customers are 
seeing virtually no effect on their 
bills from our investing in pipeline 
infrastructure. Since fiscal 2007, our 
average monthly residential bills, 
adjusted for seasonality, have been 
below $62. We expect our bills to 
remain affordable through fiscal 
2020 because of the country ’s abun-
dant supplies of low-cost natural 
gas. In fiscal 2015, our average 
monthly residential bill of $52 was 
the lowest among all household 
utility bills, based on comparable 
regional or national data.

On the surface, natural gas distribution and transmission 
may appear to be simple, but underground it’s another 
story. There, complicated technologies, nearly $7.5 billion 
of net assets and thousands of pages of federal and state 
regulations and our own standards all interact. To render 
safe and reliable service requires that our service tech-
nicians and construction and maintenance operators be 
not only dedicated, but also highly trained.

Since opening in 2010,  

Atmos Energy ’s Charles K. Vaughan 
Center has conducted more than 
37,000 hours of training for nearly 
3,800 employees, who have taken 
about 400 classes. The center offers 
some 15 standard courses and is in 
use nearly full time.

Our Charles K. Vaughan Center marked its fif th anniversary 
in 2015 as the gas industry’s best-in-class training facility. The 
center of fers fully equipped classrooms and labs along with 
two highly advanced facilities for hands-on learning. Inside 
the 48,600-square-foot center is the Flow Lab, containing 
every type of gas regulation, control and metering device used 
on our system. Outside on the 11-acre site is Gas City, a simu-
lated neighborhood with apar tments, single-residence houses, 
commercial buildings and city streets. Its flexibility reinforces 
our employees’ training for all types of real-life scenarios.

 Our employees are well-trained professionals. 
Field employees spend approximately one-fif th of 
their time in the classroom and four-fif ths practicing 
skills. Back at work, their learning continues with on-
the-job training guided by senior technicians at their 
locations. In addition, a cadre of Safety Champions 
lead monthly safety huddles to discuss best practices 
with their peers.
 Continual training and cer tification for all field 
employees is mandator y, so that they meet federal 
Operator Qualification (OQ) s tandards. A field 
employee cannot turn a valve, set a meter or locate 
an underground pipeline without having up-to-date 
OQ cer tification.
 One of the most valuable lessons we teach is not a 
technical skill—it’s a leadership skill. Called Coaching 
in the Moment, this impor tant technique prepares  
our employees to talk cour teously, but clearly, with 
others about working safely. 
 Our employees are empowered to protect them-
selves, their fellow workers and the public by commu-
nicating openly and hones tly at all times. Safety 
is always our first priority.

Table-top safety exercises stress internal de-

velopment and coordination with our communities. At a drill 
for our Mississippi Division employees, Scott Powell, Atmos 
Energy ’s director of safety, security and compliance, outlines a 
scenario to test emergency plans and responses and to help 
ensure our employees are prepared.

Our service employees are much better 
trained today, using improved techniques, 
technologies and tools. They rely on care-
fully designed safety procedures when re-
sponding to all natural gas service requests. 
They are especially vigilant when handling 
any emergency call, whether it’s a suspect-
ed gas leak or a situation involving a haz-
ardous gas release.

We train our employees to evaluate every situa-
tion carefully, to rely on engineering controls, to 
always protect customers and the public first and 
to safeguard local first responders from taking 
undue risks.
 Hazard prevention is standard procedure at 
Atmos Energy and is rooted in our safety policies, 
personal protective equipment practices, Material 
Safety Data Sheet procedures, hazardous sub-
stance training as well as basic and advanced 
skills courses.

Trevor Brewer (center), a senior service technician 
in our Kentucky/Mid-States Division at Columbia, Tennessee, 
is one of the company ’s Safety Champions. They share 
their knowledge about proper operating procedures with 
fellow employees and encourage their peers to discuss ways 
to improve safety on the job and at home.

Protecting 
Our Employees

Shoring is an extension of the personal protective equipment that 
our employees must use. All excavations below a specific depth must be 
protected with proper shoring equipment or the ditch must be tiered to 
proper standards to avoid a cave-in. Advanced training is required for 
employees who are authorized to supervise these types of excavations.

 Equally critical is driving safety for our 4,000 vehicles. We 
provide employees training for backing, Smith System driver’s 
education and first-person videos by our own employees who 
impar t lessons learned to their colleagues. We are installing 
on all vehicles new flashing lights to signal when the vehicle’s 
brakes are applied; the warning lights have proved highly 
effective at reducing collisions. We also are using inside our 
vehicles DriveCam® video technology, which records an 
employee’s performance behind the wheel for training and 
accident prevention.
 Our Enterprise Safety Commit tee sponsors some 220 
operational safety-team leads. They organize safety hud-
dles at company locations and develop Safety Champions 
who coach their peers. In safety huddles, employees share 
stories about their own experiences to help our organiza-
tion improve based on the real-life learning of these em-
ployees and their inherent credibility with fellow employees.

Improved technologies, such as this remote methane 
leak detector, help keep our employees safe while they protect the 
public. An RMLD can quickly and efficiently detect a natural gas 
leak up to 100 feet away and is used for leak surveying and respond-
ing to emergency calls.

Professional driver ’s training and backing training are 

part of our core learning program for all field technicians, who operate 
some 4,000 vehicles in daily service.

 Health and Wellness

33,000 pounds

lost by 3,900 employees
and spouses since 2010

Our health and wellness programs 

have helped 3,900 employees and their spouses work 
and live at their best by shedding 33,000 pounds 
since the programs began in 2010. Besides improving 
fitness and lowering medical insurance costs, our 
programs encourage employees to avoid injuries.

Damage prevention seminars for professional 

excavators encourage calling 811 before digging and stress industry 
best practices for safe excavation. In Austin, Texas, Texas811, the 
Austin Fire Department and Atmos Energy demonstrated not only 
how to dig safely, but also steps to take if a natural gas line is hit.

Eliminating Leaks 
and Third-Par ty 
Damages

Pipeline leaks are a primary safety focus of all  
natural gas utilities, with extensive precautions 
taken to prevent, detect and repair them.

Leaks occur for various reasons, but one of the leading 
causes is damage to pipelines caused by third par ties. This 
typically is the result of careless excavation, of ten when an 
excavator violates state law by failing to have buried utility 
facilities located and marked. Anyone excavating at depths 
greater than the state requirement must, by law, call the 
universal toll-free 811 number. The 811 Center then dis-
patches professional line locators to find all underground 
utility lines in the area and to mark them with colored flags 
and paint to guide safe digging. This service is provided  
at no cost to the excavator.

10

11

 Our damage prevention effor ts have yielded a steady
decline in damages to our pipeline systems. Since 2010, we
have reduced damages per 1,000 line locates by 11 percent.
That improvement is all the more impressive in light of the
economic development activities in our service areas that
have caused annual requests for facility-locates to rise by 24
percent since 2010 to more than 1.9 million annual requests.
 Eliminating third-par ty damages requires vigilance and 
diligence by our damage prevention specialists, who contact 
repeat of fenders to seek their cooperation to observe the 
law and to protect their workers and the public.
 An especially impor tant par t of our damage prevention
program is sponsoring training and meetings by our state
One-Call organizations to reach professional excavators.
We are a Gold Sponsor of the national Common Ground
Alliance and we are a strong ally with our states’ damage
prevention councils to promote safety.
 Along with fewer damages, the number of active leaks on
our system has declined by 31 percent since 2010.
 We continue to seek bet ter leak detection technologies
as par t of our comprehensive safety strategy. Innovative
gas-analysis instruments, involving mass spectroscopy, are
approximately 1,000 times more sensitive than traditional
leak detection equipment and are capable of sensing gas
leaks down to one par t per billion in ambient air while
reducing false positives from naturally occurring methane.
 We are conducting tests with this equipment mounted in
a vehicle to determine whether the technology can measure
and monitor methane levels from gas pipeline leaks, as 
compared to methane emissions from countless other 
sources, such as farm animals, vehicles and pollution.

In the center of downtown Dallas, Atmos Energy 

is testing an advanced leak detection technology that is much more 
sensitive for identifying methane releases than conventional methods. 
The instrumentation is installed in a standard SUV, making it highly 
mobile and allowing sampling to occur at driving speeds. The tech-
nician driving the vehicle also is informed in real time of potential 
leaks that can be investigated promptly. Right: Brandon Nelson, 
a compliance specialist in the Mid-Tex Division, and Tamera Hewitt, 
a geographic information system specialist in the division, evaluate 
maps from a survey to help identify areas needing closer attention  
for potential leaks.

An existing natural gas pipeline (below) is located by 

Jeff Knight, a crew leader in the Louisiana Division, in preparation 
to install a new main to serve additional customers in Covington. Line 
locators use colored flags and temporary spray paint to mark the routes 
of all underground utility facilities, so that excavators know to dig only 
by hand within tolerance zones around the buried lines. Line-locating 
of utility lines is provided to the public free of charge.

Increasing public awareness about natural gas safety is the best and most 
effective defense to prevent pipeline incidents.

Since 2006, Atmos Energy has conduc ted one of the indus tr y ’s bes t public awareness 
programs to reach the 23 million adults in our service areas, 31,000 public and school 
officials, 13,000 emergency officials and 219,000 professional excavators. Independent 
opinion research shows that our messages are get ting through.
 A compelling example is Call 811. Since the national One-Call number went into ef fect 
in 2007, pipeline damages on Atmos Energy’s system have dropped dramatically, declining 
from 4.0 damages per 1,000 line locates in 2008 to 2.8 in 2015. 
 According to the Common Ground A lliance, calling 811 has reduced the risk of  
damaging a pipeline to less than 1 percent if an excavator calls 811, waits until the buried 
utility lines are marked and then observes the markings on the ground while digging.

Calling 811, the national 

toll-free number to have 
all underground utility lines 
located and marked, has dra-
matically reduced third-party 
damages to pipelines and 
utility facilities. We publicize 
calling 811 through regional 
and national advertising, cus-
tomer bill inserts, community 
safety events, damage preven-
tion programs for professional 
excavators and support for the 
national Common Ground 
Alliance and our states’ dam-
age prevention councils.

At a day-long, free workshop about the 

science, engineering and technology of natural gas distri-
bution systems, pipeline inspectors from states in which we 
operate learn to fuse high-density polyethylene pipe. The 
training, held at our Charles K. Vaughan Center, gives the 
officials, many who are new to their job, hands-on experi-
ence with typical assets they will find in our operations.

Increasing Public Awareness 
about Pipeline Safety

Raising awareness with school officials about pipeline 
safety, especially at schools near our high-pressure pipeline rights 
of way, is a major program we began in 2015. At the Caddo Mills 
Middle School in Caddo Mills, Texas, Terry Katenkamp, a field 
construction coordinator in our Mid-Tex Division, shows Principal 
Anne Payne the safest route for buses to take away from our trans-
mission line in case of an evacuation.

Anthony Tetto, a senior consultant for AEGIS, our primary insurance provider, leads a Loss Control 
Review at our Mississippi Division. Drawing upon utility engineering and risk assessment expertise from 
throughout North America, AEGIS provides an objective review of our operating procedures and practices 
to help us identify potential problem areas and improve public and employee safety. In the assessment 
meetings, key operating, engineering and support personnel review safety policies, practices and programs.

We cooperate and coordinate with first responders to safeguard our 
communities. In Basehor, Kansas, Bruce Main, a crew leader in our Colorado-Kansas 
Division, conducts Natural Gas 101 training for the Fairmount Township Fire Department. 
Atmos Energy employees have provided this training for more than 1,700 first responders 
in 46 communities. Chiefs and training officers from many fire departments have praised 
our program, but those who lead rural or volunteer fire departments have been especially 
appreciative because of their limited training resources. In Mississippi, our program has 
been adopted as part of the state fire marshal training.

 To protect our customers and the public, our centralized dispatch 
center maintains around-the-clock readiness for emergency calls. We 
regularly audit our emergency-call procedures and closely monitor 
response times. We constantly strive to improve our per formance.
 Atmos Energy has been a suppor ter of stronger safety legislation 
and regulations. A showcase example of ef fective regulation is the 
natural-gas pipe testing requirement for all Texas schools. It has vir tu-
ally eliminated school gas leaks. Similarly, pipeline damage preven-
tion laws in Virginia and Louisiana have lowered third-par ty damages 
and have helped dissuade careless excavators from working in these 
states. We are presently advocating, along with other members of the 
American Gas Association, reauthorization by Congress of the federal 
Pipeline Safety Act.

 Cross-bore Safety

Our new cross-bore safety program 

warns those most at risk, such as Leon Molinario of 
Leon’s Plumbing in Metairie, Louisiana, while the 
program seeks to eliminate an unforeseen hazard. 
A cross bore is a natural gas or other utility line that 
inadvertently was installed through a sewer pipe. If a 
c log develops, plumbers and drain-cleaning technicians 
usually use a power augur to remove the blockage. 
Instead, we encourage them to use a video camera first 
to see if a cross bore is present. Here, Joseph Dimm, 
a senior service technician in the Louisiana Division, 
provides assistance.

Measuring Our 
Safety Progress

How do you know whether your 

company is the safest natural gas 
distributor in the country?

Atmos Energy consistently rates bet ter than industry averages 
on all safety measures repor ted by the American Gas Associ-
ation and by other industry organizations. We also score below 
the national averages for employee accidents repor ted by 
the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
 We focus on measuring three areas of safety. System safety 
includes excavation damages, leaks found, age of open leaks 
and unprotected bare-steel pipeline mileage. Employee safety 
tracks primarily employee injuries and vehicle collisions. 
Public safety looks at emergency response times.
 Although we have multiple safety goals to achieve within 
each of these three areas, we are more concerned with mea-
suring our overall progress of being incident-free every day, 
the top goal we strive for in our culture of safety.

 To improve our per formance, we par ticipate 
in the AGA’s peer-evaluation program of safety 
practices. Beginning with 10 pilot companies, the 
program now has 50 par ticipating utilities. Its key 
topics are: a culture of safety, worker procedures 
and risk management.
 We also par ticipate in quar terly outside audits 
of company safety processes. Conducted by our 
primary insurance provider, these Loss Control 
Reviews are rotated among our operating divisions 
to examine and assess safety procedures and to 
share best practices.
 We are especially proud that Atmos Energy em-
ployees have taken leading roles on safety commit-
tees at both the AGA and the Southern Gas Asso-
ciation. And, in key safety measures, Atmos Energy 
has a robust process for continuous improvement. 
It encourages enhancements to safety procedures 
and processes as we adopt new technologies and 
modernize our pipeline infrastructure.

Accurate and up-to-date records are essential  

to document all the work we do on our pipelines, whether installing 
a new facility, repairing it, reconfiguring it or replacing it. We have 
launched a major information technology project to deliver state-of-
the-art recordkeeping for our construction and replacement projects. 
Above, Daniel Waguespack, Lousiana Division compliance manager, 
notes changes to be made to an existing installation.

Pipeline Modernization 

Our strategy is to grow by investing in our regulated assets to 
increase their safety and reliability. Through fiscal 2020, we 
expect to spend between $5.4 billion and $6.4 billion to replace, 
fortify and expand pipelines and service lines. Work is under way 
near Canton, Texas, on one of our largest projects. We are  
adding 62 miles of new pipelines to boost reliability and to meet  
our customers’ growing demand for natural gas.

To Our Shareholders

In fiscal 2015, we made spectacular progress on our quest to become the nation’s safest natural gas distributor.

575 miles 

148,000 hours 

Highly Advanced Technology

We replaced 575 miles 
of aging natural gas 
dis tribution and trans-
mission pipelines to 
enhance the safety and 
reliability of our sys tem.

We provided nearly 
148,000 hours of 
technical and safety 
training to our ser vice 
and cons truc tion tech-
nicians to help them 
render even safer, more 
reliable and superior 
cus tomer ser vice.

We also did very well financially.

We began evaluating the lates t and mos t advanced 
technology designed to detec t pipeline leaks, and we 
launched a multi-year information technology projec t 
to manage and document the cons truc tion in our 
pipeline modernization program.

$3.09 EPS 

$1.56|share 

25.5 percent 

$63.77|share

Earnings per diluted 
share grew for the 13th 
consecutive year in fiscal 
2015, and net income 
increased by 8.7 percent 
to $315.1 million, as
compared to $289.8 
million in fiscal 2014.

Our fiscal 2015 cash 
dividend was $1.56 per 
share. In November 
2015, the board of 
directors continued our 
consecutive annual div-
idend increases for the 
32nd year by raising the 
indicated rate for fiscal 
2016 by 7.7 percent to 
$1.68 per share.

The capital inves tments we are making to replace, for tif y 
and expand our dis tribution and transmission assets are 
driving our financial results.
 Since fiscal 2010, our capital spending has risen at a 
compounded annual grow th rate of 12.4 percent to reach 
$975 million in fiscal 2015. More than 75 percent of our 
inves tment during the pas t five years has been dedicated 
to safety and reliability projec ts.
 This significant increase in capital inves tment has oc-
curred because mos t regulators in our market areas have 
approved cons truc tive and balanced rate mechanisms. 
These mechanisms provide for the recover y of more than 
90 percent of our capital within six months of the tes t year.

Total shareholder return 
in fiscal 2015 was 25.5 
percent.

The market price of our 
stock reached an all-
time high on November 
4, 2015, of $63.77 
a share.

Kim R. Cocklin

Chief Executive Officer

 The balanced regulator y environments in our markets 
today are the result of relationships built on trus t with our 
regulators, legislators, community leaders and cus tom-
ers. These relations were fos tered by our former CEO 
and current chairman, Rober t W. Bes t. Bob built upon the 
foundation laid by our founder, Charles K. Vaughan, that 
a successful utility is one that is trus ted and is focused on 
providing safe, reliable and competitively priced ser vice.

Large Investments, Yet Low Customer Bills

Regulatory authorities in the states we serve recognize the 
critical need to accelerate capital outlays to continue to 
make our safe system even safer. With the resulting rate 
mechanisms in place today, we plan to continue investing 
in our pipeline infrastructure program far into the future.
 Equally impor tant, even with these large expenditures 
for improvements, the average monthly bill for our service 
remains very af fordable.
 Our average residential bill, adjusted for seasonality, 
has averaged less than $60 a month since 2007, and we 
expect our residential bills will remain in that range for  
at least several more years.
 Af ter taking inflation into account, we expect our bills 
will actually go down. This positive benefit is occurring 
because natural gas continues to be abundant, af fordable, 
domestically available and clean. Reputable forecasts show 
prices suppor ting this outcome for at least the nex t decade.
 The net ef fect is that we are significantly upgrading our 
infrastructure—with all the incumbent benefits of public 
safety and reliability of gas deliveries even on the coldest 
days—without our customers paying more for these 
service improvements.  
 Atmos Energy’s annualized monthly gas bills, in fact, 
may be one of the lowest costs in the household budget of 
our average residential customer, as shown on page 4.

Financial Results

Contributions to fiscal 2015 net income were $205 million 
from regulated distribution operations, $94 million from 

regulated pipeline operations and $16 million from 
nonregulated operations.
 Our financial per formance continues to reflect the 
successful implementation of our long-term strategy of 
enhancing the safety and reliability of our infrastructure.
 Fiscal 2015 benefited from rate outcomes approved in 
fiscal 2014 and 2015; they increased our regulated gross 
profit by $118 million.
 Additionally, weather, which was 8 percent colder than 
normal in fiscal 2015, contributed 5 cents per diluted share 
of earnings for the year.
 Recent rate-design changes in Tennessee, Mississippi 
and Colorado are expected to suppor t increased capital 
investments in those states in the future.
 At September 30, 2015, our balance sheet had a debt-
to-capitalization ratio of 47.7 percent, compared to 46.2 
percent at year-end in fiscal 2014. The company also had 
nearly $900 million in net liquidity to meet anticipated 
financial needs.
In late September 2015, we replaced an existing $1.25 
billion revolving credit agreement, which was set to expire 
in August 2019, with a new $1.25 billion revolving credit 
agreement through September 2020 on substantially 
the same terms. The new credit agreement retains an 
“accordion” feature, which allows us the oppor tunity to 
increase the facility to $1.5 billion.
 Our strong financial position contributed to the recent 
upgrade of our corporate credit rating to A by Fitch Ratings 
and to an improvement in our outlook to Positive by 
Standard & Poor’s.

Outlook

We will continue to execute our strategy of grow th by 
investing in our existing assets.
 Our announced guidance for earnings per diluted 
share in fiscal 2016 ranges between $3.20 and $3.40, 
excluding unrealized margins. Contributions to net income 
from regulated operations are forecast to be between 
$315 million and $355 million, and net income from 
nonregulated operations is expected to be in the range of 
$14 million to $19 million.
 We operate approximately 76,000 miles of distribution 
and transmission pipelines and more than 3.1 million 
service lines connected to customers’ premises.
 Our primary focus is to replace as soon as possible 
all the remaining cast iron pipe in our system and to 
evaluate for replacement all existing bare steel pipelines. 
In addition, our modernization program will continue to 
emphasize the replacement or for tification of older coated 
steel pipelines and early-vintage plastic pipe. 
 We have replaced nearly 1,000 miles of cast iron, bare 
steel and early-generation plastic pipe since 2010, and we 
expect to double our replacement mileage during the nex t 
five years.
 We project our capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 to 
be between $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion and our annual 
capital expenditures from fiscal 2017 through fiscal 2020 
to range between $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion.
 Our total regulated rate base value is expected to grow 
at a compounded annual grow th rate between 9 percent 
and 10 percent, from approximately $5.5 billion at year-
end of fiscal 2015 to between $8.5 billion and $9.0 billion 
by fiscal 2020.
 Accordingly, we project that earnings per diluted share 
will increase between 6 percent and 8 percent a year. This 
grow th rate, combined with an at tractive dividend, should 
yield an overall shareholder return between 9 percent and 
11 percent each year through fiscal 2020.

Management Changes

As par t of our senior-management succession planning, 
the board of directors announced promotions for two key 
of ficers, ef fective October 1, 2015.
 Michael E. Haefner, 55, was promoted 
from executive vice president to president 
and chief operating of ficer of Atmos 
Energy Corporation. In this role, he has 
oversight for Atmos Energy’s regulated 
distribution divisions, customer service 
operations, regulated intrastate pipeline 
division, nonregulated operations and the gas supply and 
services group. Mike also was elected to the board of 
directors, ef fective November 4, 2015. 
 One of the most impor tant responsibilities of the board 
is to establish for the CEO position a succession plan 
that is seamless and transparent to continue the success 
of the company. It is equally impor tant that the plan is 
controlled by the board— that it is not required due to 

poor operational per formance, failing health or financial 
distress. This plan reflects the board’s deliberate and 
careful consideration and their confidence that succession 
will be successful.
 Mike had been executive vice president from January 
2015 through September 2015 and had previously served 
as senior vice president of human resources.
 Before joining Atmos Energy in 2008, he had worked 
for 10 years as senior vice president, human resources, at 
Sabre Holdings Corporation, the parent company of Sabre 
Airline Solutions, Sabre Travel Network and Travelocity. 
He also held leadership positions within Sabre from 1991 
to 1997 while it was a division of AMR Corporation, the 
parent of American Airlines. Earlier, he had worked as an 
outside management consultant for Xerox Corporation and 
in computing research at Eastman Kodak Company.
 Mike earned a bachelor’s degree in mathematics from 
St. John Fisher College and a master’s degree in computer 
science from State University of New York at Buf falo.
 Mike has the vision, experience and leadership skills, 
as well as the understanding of our culture and values, to 
ensure our continued financial and operational success.
 The board of directors also named 
Marvin L. Sweetin, 52, to the newly created 
position of senior vice president, safety 
and enterprise services. Marvin had been 
senior vice president, utility operations, 
since 2011. 
 He also had served as vice president of 
customer service, director of technical training and director 
of procurement.
 Before joining Atmos Energy in 2000, Mar vin worked at 
Atlantic R ichfield for 13 years in various roles, suppor ting 
petroleum exploration and produc tion ac tivities around 
the world.
 He earned a bachelor’s degree in petroleum engineering 
technology from Oklahoma State University and a master’s 
degree in business adminis tration from the University 
of Dallas.
Investing these two of ficers with increased responsibilities 
for the company’s success helps ensure our progress 
toward becoming the safest natural gas provider. Both 
leaders have demonstrated managerial excellence and 
made valuable contributions to our company.
 They are suppor ted by our 4,800 employees, who are 
commit ted to serving our customers exceptionally well 
while ensuring safety for themselves, their fellow employees 
and the people in the 1,408 communities we serve. On 
our journey to becoming the safest natural gas company, 
we have the right employees in the right place, get ting the 
right results the right way.

Opposite: The High Five Interchange, the first-ever confluence of five stacked highways, is a Dallas landmark. 
Its height exceeds a 12-story building and its roadways include 37 permanent bridges and other unusual 
design and construction features. One other feature is a natural gas transmission pipeline beneath the site. 
To assure greater safety and reliability, our Mid-Tex Division is replacing a segment of the 20-inch pipeline 
that crosses a creek and runs through a highly developed urban area.
